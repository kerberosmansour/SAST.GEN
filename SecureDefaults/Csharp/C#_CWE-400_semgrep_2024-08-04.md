#### Uncontrolled Resource Consumption (CWE-400) in C#

### Understanding CWE-400
CWE-400 refers to Uncontrolled Resource Consumption, commonly known as a Denial of Service (DoS) condition where a systemâ€™s resources are exhausted, affecting system availability. In C#, this can occur through various vectors like uncontrolled memory allocation, thread creation, socket opening, etc.

### Secure Defaults and Remediation Code for CWE-400
To prevent uncontrolled resource consumption, we need to implement secure coding practices, such as input validation, resource limiting, and proper error handling.

#### 1. Memory Allocation

**Vulnerable Code:**
```csharp
public void AllocateMemory(int size)
{
    byte[] buffer = new byte[size];  // Potentially large allocation
}
```

**Secure Default Code:**
```csharp
public void AllocateMemory(int size)
{
    const int MaxSize = 1024 * 1024;  // Limit to 1MB
    if(size > MaxSize)
    {
        throw new ArgumentOutOfRangeException("Requested size exceeds the allowed limit.");
    }
    byte[] buffer = new byte[size];
}
```

### 2. Thread Creation

**Vulnerable Code:**
```csharp
public void CreateThreads(int numThreads)
{
    for (int i = 0; i < numThreads; i++)
    {
        new Thread(() => {
            // Thread work
        }).Start();
    }
}
```

**Secure Default Code:**
```csharp
public void CreateThreads(int numThreads)
{
    const int MaxThreads = 10;  // Prevent excessive thread creation
    if(numThreads > MaxThreads)
    {
        throw new ArgumentOutOfRangeException("Thread count exceeds the allowed limit.");
    }

    for (int i = 0; i < numThreads; i++)
    {
        new Thread(() => {
            // Thread work
        }).Start();
    }
}
```

### 3. Socket Creation

**Vulnerable Code:**
```csharp
public void OpenSockets(int numSockets)
{
    List<Socket> sockets = new List<Socket>();
    for (int i = 0; i < numSockets; i++)
    {
        sockets.Add(new Socket(AddressFamily.InterNetwork, SocketType.Stream, ProtocolType.Tcp));
    }
}
```

**Secure Default Code:**
```csharp
public void OpenSockets(int numSockets)
{
    const int MaxSockets = 100;  // Limit number of open sockets
    if(numSockets > MaxSockets)
    {
        throw new ArgumentOutOfRangeException("Socket count exceeds the allowed limit.");
    }

    List<Socket> sockets = new List<Socket>();
    for (int i = 0; i < numSockets; i++)
    {
        sockets.Add(new Socket(AddressFamily.InterNetwork, SocketType.Stream, ProtocolType.Tcp));
    }
}
```

### Secure Library Recommendations

1. **Memory Management:**
   - Use the `System.Buffers.ArrayPool<byte>` for more controlled memory allocations.
  
2. **Concurrency Handling:**
   - Use `System.Threading.Tasks.Parallel` library for managing tasks instead of manually creating threads. This library internally uses thread pooling.

3. **Networking:**
   - Use `HttpClient` from `System.Net.Http` which is designed to be reused for multiple requests rather than opening several socket connections manually.

### Example: Using `HttpClient` over `Socket`

**Vulnerable Code:**
```csharp
public void OpenSockets(int numSockets)
{
    for (int i = 0; i < numSockets; i++)
    {
        // Direct socket creation, vulnerable to resource exhaustion
        var socket = new Socket(AddressFamily.InterNetwork, SocketType.Stream, ProtocolType.Tcp);
        socket.Connect("example.com", 80);
    }
}
```

**Secure Default Code:**
```csharp
public void UseHttpClient()
{
    const int MaxRequests = 10;  // Limit resource activity
    using(HttpClient client = new HttpClient())
    {
        for (int i = 0; i < MaxRequests; i++)
        {
            var response = client.GetAsync("http://example.com").Result;
            // Handle response
        }
    }
}
```

### Detection Using Semgrep Rules

**Example Semgrep Rule to Detect Uncontrolled Resource Consumption:**
```yaml
rules:
  - id: unchecked-memory-allocation
    patterns:
      - pattern: |
          new byte[$SIZE$]
    message: |
      Unchecked memory allocation found. Ensure size checks are in place to prevent uncontrolled resource consumption.
    languages:
      - csharp
    severity: WARNING

  - id: unchecked-thread-creation
    patterns:
      - pattern: |
          new Thread($FUNC$)
    message: |
      Unchecked thread creation found. Ensure thread count checks are in place to prevent uncontrolled resource consumption.
    languages:
      - csharp
    severity: WARNING

  - id: unchecked-socket-creation
    patterns:
      - pattern: |
          new Socket(AddressFamily.InterNetwork, SocketType.Stream, ProtocolType.Tcp)
    message: |
      Unchecked socket creation found. Ensure socket count checks are in place to prevent uncontrolled resource consumption.
    languages:
      - csharp
    severity: WARNING
```
This custom rule will help in detecting common patterns that can lead to uncontrolled resource consumption in C# applications   .

By implementing secure code practices and leveraging proactive detection using tools like Semgrep, developers can mitigate risks associated with uncontrolled resource consumption and ensure robust, resilient applications.
