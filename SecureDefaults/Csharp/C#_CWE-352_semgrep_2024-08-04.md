###### Secure Defaults and Remediation for CSRF Vulnerabilities in C#

#### Overview of CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) (CWE-352)
CSRF vulnerabilities primarily occur when malicious actors trick authenticated users into unknowingly submitting HTTP requests to a web application, leading to unintended actions such as fund transfers, password changes, or data deletions. Effective mitigation involves employing anti-CSRF tokens, same-site cookies, and enforcing secure defaults, particularly within popular C# frameworks like ASP.NET MVC and ASP.NET Core.

#### Mitigation Strategies

1. **CSRF Tokens**: Ensure that every POST, PUT, DELETE request contains a unique anti-CSRF token which the server can validate.
2. **Same-Site Cookies**: Use the `SameSite` attribute for cookies to help mitigate the risk of cross-origin requests.
3. **Secure Defaults**: Set up the framework and infrastructure in such a way that secure settings are enabled by default.

#### Implementation in Popular C# Frameworks

##### ASP.NET MVC

1. **Enable and Validate CSRF Tokens**:
    - Include the anti-forgery token in your views.
    - Validate all POST requests for the presence of the anti-forgery token.

    **Code Example**:
    ```csharp
    // Include token in view (BundleConfig.cs):
    @Html.AntiForgeryToken()

    // Validate token (HomeController.cs):
    [HttpPost]
    [ValidateAntiForgeryToken]
    public ActionResult SubmitForm(MyModel model)
    {
        // CSRF token validation happens automatically
    }
    ```

2. **Set Secure Cookies**:
    - Configure the application to use secure cookies with `SameSite` attribute set to `Strict` or `Lax`.

    **Code Example** (web.config):
    ```xml
    <system.web>
        <authentication mode="Forms">
            <forms loginUrl="~/Account/Login" timeout="2880" cookieless="UseCookies" requireSSL="true" slidingExpiration="true">
                <cookies httpOnly="true"/>
            </forms>
        </authentication>
    </system.web>
    ```

##### ASP.NET Core

1. **Enable and Validate CSRF Tokens**:
    - Use the built-in anti-CSRF features in ASP.NET Core by adding the `[ValidateAntiForgeryToken]` attribute to action methods.
    - Ensure that your form elements include an anti-forgery token.

    **Code Example**:
    ```csharp
    // Include token in view (View.cshtml):
    @Html.AntiForgeryToken()

    // Validate token (Controller.cs):
    [HttpPost]
    [ValidateAntiForgeryToken]
    public IActionResult SubmitForm(MyModel model)
    {
        if (ModelState.IsValid)
        {
            // Handle validated model
        }
        return View(model);
    }
    ```

2. **Set Secure Cookies**:
    - Configure cookies to use `SameSite` attribute and HTTPS only.

    **Code Example** (Startup.cs):
    ```csharp
    public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
    {
        services.AddAntiforgery(options => 
        { 
            options.Cookie.HttpOnly = true;
            options.Cookie.SecurePolicy = CookieSecurePolicy.Always;
            options.Cookie.SameSite = Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.SameSiteMode.Strict;
        });
    }
    ```

### Libraries and Tools for Enhanced CSRF Protection

1. **OWASP Anti-CSRF**: A comprehensive library that provides strong CSRF protection using synchronizer tokens.
2. **NWebsec**: A library designed to enhance security by adding HTTP headers. It includes additional CSRF protections.

    **Code Example**:
    ```csharp
    public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
    {
        services.AddAntiforgery(options => 
        { 
            options.Cookie.Name = "X-CSRF-TOKEN";
            options.HeaderName = "X-CSRF-TOKEN-HEADER";
        });
    }
    ```

#### Semgrep Rules for CSRF Detection
You can use Semgrep rules to detect missing CSRF protections in your C# code. Below is an example Semgrep rule:

```yaml
rules:
  - id: csurf-middleware-missing
    patterns:
      - pattern-inside: |
          public class $CLASS {
            ...
          }
      - pattern-not: |
          services.AddAntiforgery(...)
    message: The antiforgery middleware is not configured. Add `services.AddAntiforgery(...)` to the ConfigureServices method.
    languages:
      - csharp
    severity: ERROR
```

This Semgrep rule checks if the antiforgery middleware is missing from the `ConfigureServices` method in ASP.NET Core applications. By adding such rules, developers can ensure that CSRF protections are always in place.

### Conclusion

By carefully configuring your ASP.NET MVC and ASP.NET Core applications to include anti-forgery tokens, setting secure cookie attributes, and employing libraries like OWASP Anti-CSRF and NWebsec, you can significantly reduce the risk of CSRF attacks. Additionally, using tools like Semgrep can automate the detection of missing security controls, further enhancing your application's security posture【4:6†source】【4:7†source】【4:17†source】.
