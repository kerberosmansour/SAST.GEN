#### Integer Overflow or Wraparound (CWE-190) in Java

### Understanding the Vulnerability
Integer overflow or wraparound occurs when an arithmetic operation exceeds the maximum size of an integer type, causing the value to wrap around to its minimum value or produce an unexpected result. This can lead to various security issues, including logic errors, improper validation, or buffer overflows.

### Default Secure Coding Practices

1. **Use Safe Libraries and Methods**:
   - Prefer using libraries or methods that perform automatic bounds checking and handle overflow scenarios gracefully.
   - Libraries such as Google's Guava provide utilities specifically designed for safe arithmetic operations.

2. **Explicitly Handle Edge Cases**:
   - Always validate inputs and ensure they lie within expected ranges before performing arithmetic operations.
   - Use checked arithmetic operations provided in Java 8 and later using `Math.addExact()`, `Math.subtractExact()`, `Math.multiplyExact()`, and `Math.incrementExact()`.

3. **Adopt Taint Analysis**:
   - Implement taint tracking to trace dangerous data flows and ensure data goes through proper validation and sanitation processes【4:6†source】【4:7†source】.

### Detailed Recommendations and Examples

#### 1. Checked Arithmetic Operations
Enforce the use of `Math` class methods designed to throw exceptions on overflow.

**Bad Practice:**
```java
int result = a + b;
```

**Secure Recommendation:**
```java
try {
    int result = Math.addExact(a, b);
} catch (ArithmeticException ex) {
    // Handle overflow/underflow scenario
    System.err.println("Arithmetic operation resulted in overflow/underflow");
}
```

This approach prevents silent overflow issues and ensures that errors are caught and handled appropriately.

#### 2. Input Validation
Ensure that parameters are within safe bounds before performing arithmetic operations.

**Bad Practice:**
```java
public void add(int a, int b) {
    int result = a + b;
}
```

**Secure Recommendation:**
```java
public void add(int a, int b) {
    if (Integer.MAX_VALUE - a < b) {
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("Integer overflow");
    }
    int result = Math.addExact(a, b);
}
```

This ensures that operations are performed only when it is safe to do so, preventing overflow.

#### 3. Use of Third-Party Libraries for Safe Arithmetic
Use libraries like Guava to safely handle arithmetic operations.

**Example with Guava:**
```java
import com.google.common.math.IntMath;

public void add(int a, int b) {
    try {
        int result = IntMath.checkedAdd(a, b);
    } catch (ArithmeticException ex) {
        // Handle overflow
        System.err.println("Arithmetic operation resulted in overflow");
    }
}
```

This library provides simpler and more readable methods to deal with integer overflow.

### Proactive Security Controls Using Semgrep

1. **Detect Missing Checked Arithmetic Operations**:
    - Create custom Semgrep rules to identify potential integer overflow issues by detecting unsafe arithmetic operations. For instance, a rule can ensure the use of `addExact` instead of `+`.

**Example Semgrep Rule:**
```yaml
rules:
- id: java-unsafe-arithmetic
  languages: [java]
  message: Potential integer overflow due to unchecked arithmetic operation
  severity: WARNING
  patterns:
    - pattern-either:
        - pattern: $X + $Y
        - pattern: $X - $Y
        - pattern: $X * $Y
  path: "**/*.java"
  fix: "Use Math.addExact(), Math.subtractExact(), or Math.multiplyExact()"
    suggestions:
      - |-
        try {
            $X = Math.addExact($1, $2); // Adjust according to operation
        } catch (ArithmeticException ex) {
            // Handle overflow
        }
```

This rule ensures that developers are alerted whenever an unsafe arithmetic operation is detected, prompting the use of safe methods.

2. **Track Data Flow Using Taint Mode**:
    - Implementing taint-tracking Semgrep rules to ensure inputs are sanitized before being used in arithmetic operations.

**Example Semgrep Rule:**
```yaml
rules:
- id: untrusted-data-arithmetic
  sources:
    - pattern: getUntrustedData()
  sinks:
    - pattern: $X + $Y
  message: Untrusted data used in arithmetic operation can lead to integer overflow
  languages: [java]
  severity: ERROR
```

### Secure Library Recommendations

- **Google Guava**:
  - Use the Guava library's `IntMath` methods for safe integer arithmetic.
    - Repository: [Google Guava](https://github.com/google/guava)
    - Maven Dependency:
      ```xml
      <dependency>
          <groupId>com.google.guava</groupId>
          <artifactId>guava</artifactId>
          <version>30.1.1-jre</version>
      </dependency>
      ```

Implementing these secure practices and leveraging powerful static analysis tools like Semgrep can significantly reduce the risks associated with integer overflow in Java applications while maintaining a good developer experience and minimizing false positives/negatives. 

### Summary

By incorporating these checks, ensuring thorough input validation, leveraging checked arithmetic operations, and using robust static analysis tactics such as those provided by Semgrep, developers can create secure defaults, preventing integer overflow vulnerabilities more effectively  .
