BasedBased on the context provided and the typical structure of writing Semgrep SAST rules, here is how you can create a Semgrep rule to detect "Uncontrolled Search Path Element (CWE-427)" vulnerabilities in Java:

### Semgrep Rule for Uncontrolled Search Path Element (CWE-427) in Java

```yaml
rules:
  - id: java-uncontrolled-search-path-element
    languages: [java]
    message: "Uncontrolled Search Path Element (CWE-427) detected"
    severity: ERROR
    patterns:
      - pattern: $VAR = System.getenv($ENV_VAR)
      - metavariable-pattern:
          metavariable: $ENV_VAR
          pattern: *PATH
    - pattern-let: |
        $PATH_ELEMENT = $METHOD_CALL(...)
        ...
    - patterns:
        - pattern-either:
            - pattern: Runtime.getRuntime().exec($PATH_ELEMENT)
            - pattern: new ProcessBuilder($PATH_ELEMENT).start()
        - metavariable-pattern:
            metavariable: $METHOD_CALL
            pattern: System.getenv

```

### Explanation

1. **Rule Metadata**: The rule is given a unique `id`, specifies the language (`java`), and provides a `message` and `severity` level for when it matches.

2. **Patterns**:
   - The first pattern matches instances where a variable is assigned the value of an environment variable.
   - The `metavariable-pattern` then ensures that the environment variable being assigned relates to some form of path (like `PATH`, `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`, etc.).
   - The `pattern-let` pattern captures the method call which retrieves the environment variable.
   - Following patterns (`pattern-either`) match two different ways these values might be passed to dangerous methods like `Runtime.getRuntime().exec` or `ProcessBuilder`.

This should cover variations of how this vulnerability might occur across different popular frameworks in Java. Make sure to continuously test and iterate on your rule as you encounter new patterns and edge cases.
