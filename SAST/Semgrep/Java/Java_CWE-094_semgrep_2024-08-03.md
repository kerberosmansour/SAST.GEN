ToTo write a Semgrep SAST rule for detecting improper control of code generation (CWE-094) vulnerabilities in Java, you should follow the principles highlighted in the content you provided. Here is how you can structure such a rule:

1. **Purposeful and Clear Rule Definition:** Define the rule's purpose explicitly.
2. **Utilize Metavariables and Pattern Keywords:** Use metavariables to generalize patterns and include multiple potentially vulnerable code patterns.
3. **Minimize False Positives:** Utilize `pattern-not` and other exclusion patterns when necessary.
4. **Optimize Performance:** Consider performance implications and provide optimizations where possible.

### Example Rule: CWE-094 — Improper Control of Generation of Code in Java

```yaml
rules:
  - id: java-code-injection
    languages: [java]
    message: "Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection') (CWE-094)"
    severity: ERROR
    patterns:
      # Detect runtime JavaScript code execution
      - pattern: |
          $METHOD.invoke($OBJ, $ARGS)
          ...
          $VAR.executeScript($CODE)
      # Specifically targetting Reflection API misuse
      - pattern: |
          $METHOD.invoke($OBJ, new Object[] { (Object[]) $CODE })
      # Detect usage of potentially dangerous methods in popular frameworks
      - pattern: |
          $HTTP_SERVLET_REQUEST.getParameter($PARAM)
          ...
          $VAR.execute($CODE)
      # Use ellipsis to cover different forms of the attack vector
      - pattern-inside: |
          {
            ...
            $METHOD.invoke($OBJ, $ARGS)
            ...
          }
      - pattern-inside: |
          {
            ...
            $VAR.executeScript($CODE)
            ...
          }
      - pattern-inside: |
          {
            ...
            $VAR.execute($CODE)
            ...
          }
    metadata:
      cwe: "CWE-094"
      owasp: "A1:2019-Injection"
      source: "https://example.com/my-custom-semgrep-rule"
    fix: |
      // Use vetted libraries or frameworks; avoid using Reflection or dynamic code execution.
      // Example fix: validate and sanitize all inputs appropriately.
      public class SafeCodeExecution {
          public void safeExecute(String code) {
              // Allow only specific inputs after validating them
              if (isValid(code)) {
                  // Safe code execution
              }
          }

          private boolean isValid(String code) {
              // Implement validation logic
              return true; // Replace with actual validation
          }
      }
```

### Explanation:

1. **patterns**: Defined a set of common patterns that might indicate an improper control of code generation.
   - Included patterns for detecting `invoke`, `executeScript`, and several other methods commonly misused for code injection.
2. **metavariable-pattern** and **patterns**: Used to catch different variations of how the vulnerability can occur.
3. **pattern-inside**: Ensured that the pattern is applicable in different contexts.
4. **metadata**: Added metadata for CWE, OWASP reference, and a source link for better understanding.
5. **fix**: Provided a fix to show how developers can avoid improper control of code generation by validating and sanitizing inputs.

This rule can be used and further extended to include more patterns specific to other frameworks or specific cases that could lead to CWE-094 vulnerabilities.
