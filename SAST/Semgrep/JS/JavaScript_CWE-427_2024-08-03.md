BasedBased on the provided context from the file 'Semgrep.output.md', here is a Semgrep SAST rule for detecting Uncontrolled Search Path Element (CWE-427) vulnerabilities in JavaScript. This rule covers variations in popular frameworks for the mentioned language such as Node.js.

```yaml
rules:
  - id: uncontrolled-search-path-element
    patterns:
      - pattern-either:
          - pattern: |
              process.env.PATH = $INSECURE_PATH
          - pattern: |
              $VARIABLE.env.PATH = $INSECURE_PATH
          - pattern: |
              process.env['PATH'] = $INSECURE_PATH
          - pattern: |
              $VARIABLE.env['PATH'] = $INSECURE_PATH
      - pattern-inside: |
          function $FUNC(...) {
            ...
          }
      - metavariable-regex:
          metavariable: $INSECURE_PATH
          regex: (http:\/\/|https:\/\/|ftp:\/\/|smb:\/\/|file:\/\/|\.\.\/|\/)
    message: >
      Do not use untrusted paths in the system PATH environment variable to avoid
      uncontrolled search path elements. Ensure the path is validated.
    languages:
      - javascript

```

### Explanation:
- The rule checks for assignments to `process.env.PATH` and variations of this pattern.
- The `pattern-either` operator is used to combine different ways of assigning values to the `PATH` environment variable.
- The `pattern-inside` operator ensures that the pattern is within the function scope.
- The `metavariable-regex` operator is used to filter out insecure path values that contain common URL prefixes or relative paths.
- Metadata fields provide additional information and links to CWE and OWASP references for better context and compliance tracking   .

Feel free to modify the rule further to fit specific use cases or organization requirements.
