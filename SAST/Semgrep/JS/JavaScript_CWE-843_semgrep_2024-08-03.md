ToTo generate Semgrep SAST rules for identifying "Access of Resource Using Incompatible Type ('Type Confusion') (CWE-843)" in JavaScript, we'll employ the constructs we've identified from the documents. Here's a comprehensive set of rules that address possible variations in popular JavaScript frameworks.

### Semgrep Rule for Type Confusion in JavaScript

```yaml
rules:
  - id: type-confusion-dynamic-casting
    patterns:
      - pattern: |
          if (typeof $VAR1 === "$TYPE1") {
            ...
            $VAR2 = <cast>($VAR3);
            ...
          }
      - pattern-either:
          - pattern: |
              var $VAR2 = <cast>($VAR3)
          - pattern: |
              let $VAR2 = <cast>($VAR3)
          - pattern: |
              const $VAR2 = <cast>($VAR3)
    message: Detected potential type confusion through dynamic casting.
    severity: ERROR
    languages: [javascript]

  - id: type-confusion-unsafe-assignment
    patterns:
      - pattern: |
          if (someCondition) {
            ...
            $VAR1 = $ANY_VAR;
            ...
            $FUNC($VAR1);
          }
    message: Detected potential type confusion due to unsafe assignment followed by a function call.
    severity: ERROR

  - id: type-confusion-js-in-frameworks
    patterns:
      - pattern-either:
          - pattern: |
              $component.dialog.open({
                title: '...',
                content: $DATA
              });
          - pattern: |
              $element.setAttribute('data-value', $DATA);
          - pattern: |
              $scope.$apply(function($applyData) {
                $scope.someVar = $DATA;
              });
      - metavariable-pattern:
          metavariable: $DATA
          pattern-either:
            - pattern: |
                (Number)$VAR
            - pattern: |
                (String)$VAR
            - pattern: |
                (Boolean)$VAR
    message: Potential type confusion detected in framework-specific method.
    severity: ERROR
    languages: [javascript, typescript]

  - id: type-confusion-implicit-coercion
    patterns:
      - pattern-either:
          - pattern: |
              if (typeof $VAR === "string") {
                $VAR * $anyNumber;
              }
          - pattern: |
              if (typeof $VAR === "number") {
                $VAR + $anyString;
              }
      - pattern-not: |
          $VAR = ...;  // Ensure variable is not explicitly cast to correct type in the following lines.
    message: Type confusion through implicit coercion identified.
    severity: ERROR
    languages: [javascript]
```

### Explanation

1. **Dynamic Casting Rule (`type-confusion-dynamic-casting`)**:
   - This rule matches patterns where a variable is dynamically cast to another type within a type check context, which introduces type confusion.

2. **Unsafe Assignment Rule (`type-confusion-unsafe-assignment`)**:
   - This pattern looks for unsafe assignments followed by function calls which can lead to different types being used in ways that may be unintended.

3. **Framework-specific Rule (`type-confusion-js-in-frameworks`)**:
   - This rule covers common patterns in popular JavaScript frameworks (e.g., AngularJS, Vue.js) where type confusion might occur due to incorrect data handling types.

4. **Implicit Coercion Rule (`type-confusion-implicit-coercion`)**:
   - This rule flags potential type confusion that can occur through JavaScript's implicit type coercion mechanisms during mathematical and string operations.

These rules leverage various Semgrep constructs like `pattern-either`, `metavariable-pattern`, and `pattern-not` to accurately detect patterns indicating type confusion vulnerabilities in JavaScript code.

Refer to the detailed examples and explainers provided in the referenced documents to fine-tune the rules and ensure they work across different types of JavaScript codebases and frameworks【4:0†source】   .
