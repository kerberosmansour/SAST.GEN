BasedBased on the information in your document and standard practices for detecting improper control of the generation of code (code injection) vulnerabilities in JavaScript using Semgrep, here is an example of how to create a Semgrep SAST rule. This rule aims to cover variations in popular JavaScript frameworks:

```yaml
rules:
  - id: detect-code-injection
    patterns:
      - pattern-either:
          - pattern: |
              eval($CODE)
          - pattern: |
              setTimeout($CODE, ...)
          - pattern: |
              setInterval($CODE, ...)
          - pattern: |
              new Function($ARGS, $CODE)
          - pattern: |
              document.write($CODE)
    message: "Potential code injection vulnerability detected in evaluating or executing code. Avoid using eval(), setTimeout(), setInterval(), new Function(), or document.write() with dynamic code to prevent code injection risks."
    languages: [javascript]
    severity: ERROR
    metadata:
      cwe: "CWE-94"
      confidence: "HIGH"
      likelihood: "HIGH"
      impact: "HIGH"
      subcategory: "vuln"
    path_patterns:
      - "**/*.js"
      - "**/*.jsx"
      - "**/*.ts"
      - "**/*.tsx"
```

### Explanation
1. **ID**: `detect-code-injection` - A unique identifier for the rule.
2. **Patterns**:
   - **pattern-either** is used to match any one of the potential code injection sinks in JavaScript.
   - **eval($CODE)**: Detects the use of `eval` function, which is a common source of code injection vulnerabilities.
   - **setTimeout($CODE, ...)** and **setInterval($CODE, ...)**: These detect the use of `setTimeout` and `setInterval` functions with a code string argument.
   - **new Function($ARGS, $CODE)**: Detects when a `Function` object is created with a code string.
   - **document.write($CODE)**: Detects the use of `document.write` for writing dynamic HTML content.
3. **Message**: Describes the potential issue and suggests avoiding dynamic code evaluation or execution.
4. **Languages**: Specifies that the rule applies to JavaScript (`.js`, `.jsx`, `.ts`, and `.tsx` files).
5. **Severity**: The severity level is set to `ERROR` indicating a critical security issue.
6. **Metadata**:
   - **cwe**: CWE-94, relating to Code Injection vulnerabilities.
   - **confidence**: Set to `HIGH`, indicating high confidence in the rule’s detections.
   - **likelihood**: Set to `HIGH`, indicating that the presence of these patterns is likely to signify a vulnerability.
   - **impact**: Set to `HIGH`, indicating a high security impact if the vulnerability is exploited.
   - **subcategory**: Categorizes this rule as detecting security vulnerabilities (`vuln`).

This rule will help in initially detecting potential code injection issues in a JavaScript codebase by identifying and flagging the usage of known dangerous functions and methods that can lead to such vulnerabilities. By integrating this Semgrep rule into your CI/CD pipeline or development process, you can proactively identify and mitigate code injection risks.
