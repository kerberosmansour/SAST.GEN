To create Semgrep rules targeting the "Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information (CWE-319)" vulnerability in C#, you will need to handle various patterns involving HTTP and WebSocket communications that transmit sensitive data without encryption. Here's a guide to create such rules, ensuring high false-negative and low false-positive rates:

### Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information (CWE-319) in C#

#### Rule 1: Detecting HTTP URLs in Methods
Many instances of this vulnerability occur when data is being transmitted over HTTP instead of HTTPS. This rule detects any HTTP URL (likely indicating an unencrypted transmission).

```yaml
rules:
  - id: csharp-cleartext-http-connection
    patterns:
      - pattern: $V = new HttpClient()
      - pattern-either:
          - pattern: |
              $V.BaseAddress = "http://$URL"
          - pattern: |
              $V.DefaultRequestHeaders.Add("http://$URL", ...)
      - pattern-not: |
              $V.BaseAddress = "https://$URL"
      - pattern-not: |
              $V.DefaultRequestHeaders.Add("https://$URL", ...)
    message: "Found potentially insecure cleartext HTTP connection."
    severity: WARNING
    languages: [csharp]
```

#### Rule 2: Identifying WebSockets without TLS
WebSocket connections should also be checked to ensure they use secure connections (wss:// instead of ws://).

```yaml
rules:
  - id: csharp-cleartext-websocket-connection
    patterns:
      - pattern: $W = new WebSocket("ws://$URL", ...)
      - pattern-not: $W = new WebSocket("wss://$URL", ...)
    message: "Found potentially insecure WebSocket connection without TLS."
    severity: WARNING
    languages: [csharp]
```

#### Rule 3: Detecting Insecure Data Transfer in Hard-Coded Strings
Another common source of this issue is the use of hardcoded URLs directly in methods or string assignments. 

```yaml
rules:
  - id: csharp-cleartext-data-transfer-direct-strings
    patterns:
      - pattern: $V = "http://$URL"
      - pattern-not: $V = "https://$URL"
    message: "Found potentially insecure direct string assignment using HTTP."
    severity: WARNING
    languages: [csharp]
```

#### Rule 4: Searching for HTTP Client Requests
Intercept HTTP requests that might be transmitting sensitive information via HttpClient.

```yaml
rules:
  - id: csharp-httpclient-insecure-get-post
    patterns:
      - pattern: |
          var $CLIENT = new HttpClient();
          var $RESPONSE = $CLIENT.GetAsync("http://$URL");
      - pattern-not: |
          var $CLIENT = new HttpClient();
          var $RESPONSE = $CLIENT.GetAsync("https://$URL");
    message: "Found potentially insecure HTTP GET request."
    severity: WARNING
    languages: [csharp]
  - id: csharp-httpclient-insecure-get-post
    patterns:
      - pattern: |
          var $CLIENT = new HttpClient();
          var $RESPONSE = $CLIENT.PostAsync("http://$URL", ... );
      - pattern-not: |
          var $CLIENT = new HttpClient();
          var $RESPONSE = $CLIENT.PostAsync("https://$URL", ... );
    message: "Found potentially insecure HTTP POST request."
    severity: WARNING
    languages: [csharp]
```

### Implementation Details

These rules leverage the use of `pattern`, `pattern-either`, and `pattern-not` to precisely match scenarios where security is compromised by using HTTP instead of HTTPS. The use of metavariables ensures that different parts of the code pattern are correctly matched or ignored based on context.

Ensure to test these rules thoroughly on sample C# projects to adjust and refine patterns for reducing false positives and negatives.
