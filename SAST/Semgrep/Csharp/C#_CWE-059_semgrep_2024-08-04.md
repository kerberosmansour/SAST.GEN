To create a Semgrep SAST rule to detect **Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following') (CWE-059)** in C#, we need to account for common libraries and frameworks used in C# that deal with file handling, such as `System.IO`.

### Step-by-Step Guide to Write the Rule

1. **Identify the Vulnerability Pattern:** We need to locate instances in the code where symbolic links might be followed improperly before accessing the file.

2. **Metavariables and Patterns:** Use `metavariables` to capture the function arguments or relevant parts of the code that match our pattern criteria.

3. **Ellipsis Operator:** Utilize ellipsis (`...`) to generalize the code pathways leading up to the vulnerable code pattern to avoid false negatives.

### Sample Semgrep Rule

Here is a comprehensive Semgrep rule that targets improper link resolution in `System.IO` operations in C#. This rule scans for instances where symbolic links may be improperly followed and used before securely checking their resolution.

```yaml
rules:
  - id: improper-link-resolution
    patterns:
      - pattern: |
          if (System.IO.File.Exists($FILENAME)) { ... }
      - pattern: |
          $var = System.IO.File.ReadAll*($FILENAME)
      - pattern-not: |
          if (...) {
            ...
            $var = System.IO.File.ReadAll*($FILENAME)
            ...
          }
      - pattern-not: |
          if (...) {
            ...
            if(...) {
              ...
              if (System.IO.File.Exists($FILENAME)) {
                ...
                  $var = System.IO.File.ReadAll*($FILENAME)
                ...
              }
              ...
            } 
            ...
          }
    message: Improper Link Resolution Before File Access Detected for $FILENAME. Ensure that the symbolic link is securely resolved.
    languages: [csharp]
    severity: WARNING
```

> **Explanation:**
> - **patterns:** The core logic of the rule is captured using `patterns`.
>   - The main `pattern` looks for an `if` statement checking if a file exists, followed by some ellipsis to match any code within the block.
>   - It then looks for operations like `File.ReadAllText`, `File.ReadAllLines`, etc., performed on the same filename variable within these conditions.
>   - `pattern-not` blocks are used to exclude nested secure checking patterns to reduce false positives.
> - This rule relies on the observation that the improper link resolution occurs when files are accessed without secure checks on symbolic links.

**Variations for Popular Frameworks:**

In frameworks like ASP.NET, you might encounter variations where file handling is done through API controllers or similar constructs. Adjust the patterns accordingly to encompass such scenarios.

```yaml
rules:
  - id: improper-link-resolution-aspnet
    patterns:
      - pattern: |
          if (System.IO.File.Exists($FILENAME)) { ... }
      - pattern: |
          $var = System.IO.File.ReadAll*($FILENAME)
      - pattern-either:
        - pattern: |
            void $METHOD(...) {
              ...
              if (System.IO.File.Exists($FILENAME)) {
                ...
                $var = System.IO.File.ReadAll*($FILENAME)
              }
              ...
            }
        - pattern: |
            public IActionResult $ACTION(...) {
              ...
              if (System.IO.File.Exists($FILENAME)) {
                ...
                $var = System.IO.File.ReadAll*($FILENAME)
              }
              ...
            }
        - pattern: |
            public async Task<IActionResult> $ACTION(...) {
              ...
              if (System.IO.File.Exists($FILENAME)) {
                ...
                $var = System.IO.File.ReadAll*($FILENAME)
              }
              ...
            }
    message: Improper Link Resolution Before File Access Detected for $FILENAME. Ensure that the symbolic link is securely resolved.
    languages: [csharp]
    severity: WARNING
```

Use these rules as a starting point and refine them based on specific patterns and code structures within your codebase to further minimize false-positive rates.
