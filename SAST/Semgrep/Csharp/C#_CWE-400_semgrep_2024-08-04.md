To create Semgrep SAST rules for the vulnerability "Uncontrolled Resource Consumption (CWE-400)" in C#, we can follow the guidelines and examples provided in `Semgrep.output.md` to ensure we write rules with high false negative rates and low false positive rates.

### Semgrep Rule Configuration for CWE-400 in C#

Here are the steps and examples to help craft effective rules:

#### 1. Identify the patterns
First, we need to identify common patterns in C# that could lead to uncontrolled resource consumption. This typically includes unbounded loops, unclosed streams or resources, and excessive recursion.

#### 2. Using Metavariables and Comparisons
To accommodate variations and different frameworks, we can employ metavariables and comparison patterns:

```yaml
rules:
  - id: uncontrolled-resource-consumption-loop
    languages: [csharp]
    message: Potential uncontrolled resource consumption in a loop.
    patterns:
      - pattern: |
          for (var $VAR = 0; $VAR < $LIMIT; $VAR++) { ... }
      - metavariable-comparison:
          metavariable: $LIMIT
          comparison: $LIMIT > 10000  # Arbitrary high limit for demo purposes; refine as needed.
    severity: ERROR

  - id: uncontrolled-resource-consumption-stream
    languages: [csharp]
    message: Ensure the stream is properly closed or disposed to avoid resource exhaustion.
    pattern: |
      new $STREAM(...) { ... }
    pattern-not: |
      try { ... } finally { $STREAM.Close(); }
    severity: WARNING

  - id: uncontrolled-resource-recursion
    languages: [csharp]
    message: Recursive calls could lead to uncontrolled resource consumption.
    pattern: |
      $RET_TYPE $FUNC_NAME($ARGS) {
        if ($CONDITION) {
          return $FUNC_NAME($NEW_ARGS);
        }
        ...
      }
    severity: WARNING
```

#### 3. Combining Patterns, Excluding Safe Usages

### Handling Framework Variations:
To target specific frameworks like ASP.NET, you can add rules that consider framework-specific patterns:

```yaml
rules:
  - id: aspnet-large-file-upload
    languages: [csharp]
    message: Ensure large file uploads are properly controlled.
    pattern: |
      [HttpPost]
      public IActionResult UploadFile(IFormFile $FILE) {
        ...
      }
    pattern-inside: |
      [Authorize]
      private class Controller { ... }
    severity: WARNING
    metadata:
      cwe: "CWE-400"
```

### Optimizing and Testing:

**Testing in Playground:** 

To test these rules, use the [Semgrep Playground](https://semgrep.dev) or local environment. Implement testing with `# ruleid: <id>` and `# nosemgrep` comments to ensure rules are effective without catching false positives.

```csharp
// ruleid: uncontrolled-resource-consumption-loop
for (var i = 0; i < 100000; i++) {
  // potentially excessive iteration
}

// ruleid: uncontrolled-resource-consumption-stream
var stream = new FileStream("path/to/file", FileMode.Open);
try {
  // Do something with the stream
} finally {
  // stream.Close(); // Ensure this line is uncommented in actual use
}

// ruleid: uncontrolled-resource-recursion
int Factorial(int n) {
  if (n <= 1) return 1;
  return n * Factorial(n - 1);
}
```

**Additional Considerations:**

* **Metadata**: Provide additional metadata such as `cwe: CWE-400` and `severity`.
* **Excluding Code Sections**: Use `// nosemgrep` where necessary to avoid false positives.

By following these structured steps, you can create robust Semgrep SAST rules that accurately detect variations of uncontrolled resource consumption vulnerabilities across different C# frameworks.
