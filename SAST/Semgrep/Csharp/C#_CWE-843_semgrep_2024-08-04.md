To craft a Semgrep SAST (Static Application Security Testing) rule tailored for detecting the vulnerability associated with "Access of Resource Using Incompatible Type ('Type Confusion') (CWE-843)" in C#, it is essential to cover different variations and popular frameworks in the language. Here’s how you can structure your Semgrep rule:

### Semgrep SAST Rule for CWE-843 in C#

```yaml
rules:
  - id: csharp-type-confusion
    patterns:
      - pattern: $VAR1 = ($CASTTYPE)$VAR2
      - ellipsis: ...
      - pattern-not: $CASTTYPE == typeof($VAR2)
    message: Potential type confusion detected where $VAR2 is cast to $CASTTYPE
    languages: [csharp]
    severity: ERROR
```

### Breakdown of the Rule

- **ID**: `csharp-type-confusion` — The unique identifier for this rule.
  
- **Patterns**: The specific pattern we are matching against. Here we use simple patterns and metavariables:
  - **Casting Pattern**: `$VAR1 = ($CASTTYPE)$VAR2` — This pattern matches instances where a variable `$VAR2` is being cast to a different type `$CASTTYPE`.
  - **Ellipsis (`...`)**: This abstraction matches sequences of zero or more expressions, statements, or other items.
  - **Pattern Not**: We utilize a negative pattern to ensure `$CASTTYPE` is not the same as `$VAR2`'s type, which helps reduce false positives.

### Example Code and Explanation

The rule aims to detect scenarios where type casting might lead to type confusion. Let's break down an example code snippet that this rule would match:

```csharp
object someObject = 42;
string str = (string)someObject;
```

- The rule will look for assignments where a variable (`$VAR2`) is being cast to another variable (`$CASTTYPE`) and ensure their types are not the same (`pattern-not`).

This rule effectively catches potential type confusion issues by identifying casts where the type being cast to is not inherently compatible with the type of the operand.

### Adding Framework-specific Variations

For frameworks and libraries commonly used in C#, such as ASP.NET, Entity Framework, and Unity, you might need to adjust the rule or add additional patterns to cover specific APIs where type confusion might be prone to happen. Here are some variances for ASP.NET:

```yaml
rules:
  - id: csharp-aspnet-type-confusion
    patterns:
      - pattern-inside: |
          public class $CLASS {
            public void $METHOD(...) {
              ...
              $VAR1 = ($CASTTYPE)$VAR2;
              ...
            }
          }
      - pattern-not: $CASTTYPE == typeof($VAR2)
    message: Potential type confusion detected in ASP.NET controller action where $VAR2 is cast to $CASTTYPE
    languages: [csharp]
    severity: ERROR
```

### Conclusion

These rules are designed to catch common type confusion vulnerabilities in C#. For best results, you should test and refine the rules in your specific codebase and environment. Pay attention to any false positives and adjust the `pattern-not` section as necessary to minimize them.
