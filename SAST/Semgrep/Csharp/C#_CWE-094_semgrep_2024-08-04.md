To write Semgrep SAST rules for detecting Code Injection vulnerabilities (`CWE-094`) in C#, you need to create rules that identify patterns which could allow for arbitrary code execution when user input is directly concatenated or interpreted as code.

Here's a comprehensive set of Semgrep rules for this purpose, targeting popular C# web frameworks such as ASP.NET:

### Rule 1: Detecting `Eval` with User Input
```yaml
rules:
  - id: csharp-eval-user-input
    patterns:
      - pattern: |
          eval($INPUT)
      - pattern-either:
          - pattern: $INPUT = Request["..."]
          - pattern: $INPUT = Request.Form["..."]
          - pattern: $INPUT = Request.QueryString["..."]
    message: "Avoid using eval() with user inputs to prevent code injection vulnerabilities."
    severity: ERROR
    languages: [csharp]
    metadata:
      cwe: CWE-94
      owasp: A1:2017-Injection
```

### Rule 2: Detecting `Command` Execution with User Input
```yaml
rules:
  - id: csharp-command-exec-user-input
    patterns:
      - pattern: |
          System.Diagnostics.Process.Start($CMD)
      - pattern-either:
          - pattern: $CMD = Request["..."]
          - pattern: $CMD = Request.Form["..."]
          - pattern: $CMD = Request.QueryString["..."]
    message: "Avoid using System.Diagnostics.Process.Start() with user inputs to prevent command injection vulnerabilities."
    severity: ERROR
    languages: [csharp]
    metadata:
      cwe: CWE-94
      owasp: A1:2017-Injection
```

### Rule 3: Detecting `CScriptEngine` with User Input
```yaml
rules:
  - id: csharp-scriptengine-user-input
    patterns:
      - pattern: |
          Microsoft.ClearScript.ScriptEngine.Execute($SCRIPT)
      - pattern-either:
          - pattern: $SCRIPT = Request["..."]
          - pattern: $SCRIPT = Request.Form["..."]
          - pattern: $SCRIPT = Request.QueryString["..."]
    message: "Avoid using Microsoft.ClearScript.ScriptEngine.Execute with user inputs to prevent script injection vulnerabilities."
    severity: ERROR
    languages: [csharp]
    metadata:
      cwe: CWE-94
      owasp: A1:2017-Injection
```

### Rule 4: Detecting `HttpContext` Dynamic Compilation with User Input
```yaml
rules:
  - id: csharp-dynamic-compilation-user-input
    patterns:
      - pattern: |
          HttpContext.Current.Application[$KEY] = $VALUE
      - pattern-either:
          - pattern: $VALUE = Request["..."]
          - pattern: $VALUE = Request.Form["..."]
          - pattern: $VALUE = Request.QueryString["..."]
    message: "Avoid dynamic compilation or execution using HttpContext with user inputs to prevent code injection vulnerabilities."
    severity: ERROR
    languages: [csharp]
    metadata:
      cwe: CWE-94
      owasp: A1:2017-Injection
```

### Rule 5: Detecting `Roslyn` Compilation with User Input
```yaml
rules:
  - id: csharp-roslyn-compile-user-input
    patterns:
      - pattern: |
          Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp.CSharpScript.EvaluateAsync($CODE)
      - pattern-either:
          - pattern: $CODE = Request["..."]
          - pattern: $CODE = Request.Form["..."]
          - pattern: $CODE = Request.QueryString["..."]
    message: "Avoid using Roslyn API for dynamic script compilation with user inputs to prevent code injection vulnerabilities."
    severity: ERROR
    languages: [csharp]
    metadata:
      cwe: CWE-94
      owasp: A1:2017-Injection
```

These rules collectively address common ways in C# where code injection could happen by misusing user input in code execution contexts. Each rule has a clear message, severity, and relevant metadata to help in categorizing and understanding the potential threats     .
