Based on the extracted context from your provided document, here is a set of Semgrep SAST rules tailored for detecting XML External Entity (XXE) vulnerabilities (CWE-611) in C#. These rules aim to provide high accuracy with low false positives.

### Semgrep Rule for CWE-611 in C#

```yaml
rules:
  - id: csharp-xml-xxe
    patterns:
      - pattern: |
          var xmlReader = XmlReader.Create(...);
      - pattern-not-inside: |
          var settings = new XmlReaderSettings
          {
              DtdProcessing = DtdProcessing.Prohibit
          };
    message: "XML External Entities (XXE) detected. Ensure DTD processing is disabled."
    languages: [csharp]
    severity: ERROR
    metadata:
      cwe: CWE-611
      owasp: A4:XXE
  - id: csharp-xml-document-xxe
    patterns:
      - pattern: |
          var xmlDoc = new XmlDocument();
          $XML.Load(...);
      - pattern-not-inside: |
          $XML.XmlResolver = null;
    message: "XML External Entities (XXE) detected. Ensure XmlResolver is set to null."
    languages: [csharp]
    severity: ERROR
    metadata:
      cwe: CWE-611
      owasp: A4:XXE
  - id: csharp-linq-xml-xxe
    patterns:
      - pattern: |
          var xml = XDocument.Load(...);
      - pattern-not-inside: |
          var settings = new XmlReaderSettings
          {
              DtdProcessing = DtdProcessing.Prohibit
          };
          var reader = XmlReader.Create(..., settings);
          var xml = XDocument.Load(reader);
    message: "XML External Entities (XXE) detected. Use XmlReader with DtdProcessing set to Prohibit."
    languages: [csharp]
    severity: ERROR
    metadata:
      cwe: CWE-611
      owasp: A4:XXE
```

### Explanation
1. **csharp-xml-xxe**: 
   - Detects instances where `XmlReader.Create` is used without properly setting `DtdProcessing` to `Prohibit`.
   - This pattern ensures that DTD processing is disabled to mitigate XXE attacks.

2. **csharp-xml-document-xxe**: 
   - Detects uses of `XmlDocument` without setting `XmlResolver` to `null`.
   - Setting `XmlResolver` to `null` prevents the loading of external DTDs, reducing the risk of XXE.

3. **csharp-linq-xml-xxe**:
   - Detects instances where `XDocument.Load` is used without the secure `XmlReaderSettings`.
   - This pattern ensures `XDocument.Load` uses an `XmlReader` with `DtdProcessing` set to `Prohibit`, enhancing security by mitigating XXE.

### Testing the Rules
To ensure accuracy and robustness, test the rules with different code samples susceptible to XXE vulnerabilities. You can use the Semgrep Playground or run Semgrep with these rules against your codebase:

```bash
semgrep --config <path_to_yaml_file>
```

By implementing these rules, you ensure that common variations of XXE vulnerabilities in your C# code are detected and can be addressed effectively, following best security practices【4:0†source】【4:1†source】【4:2†source】.
