To create robust Semgrep SAST rules for detecting the vulnerability "Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')" (CWE-077) in C#, hereâ€™s the set of rules. These rules cover different variations of how this vulnerability might manifest in popular C# frameworks such as ASP.NET and others.

### Rule 1: Detecting `Process.Start` with Unchecked User Input
Detects the use of `Process.Start` when it uses unchecked user input in C#.

```yaml
rules:
  - id: csharp-process-start-command-injection
    languages: [csharp]
    message: Detected potential command injection via Process.Start with unchecked user input.
    severity: ERROR
    patterns:
      - pattern-either:
          - pattern: |
              using System.Diagnostics;
              ...
              var process = Process.Start($COMMAND);
          - pattern: |
              System.Diagnostics.Process.Start($COMMAND);
      - metavariable-pattern:
          metavariable: $COMMAND
          pattern-not: $SAFE_COMMAND  
```
This rule looks for occurrences of `Process.Start` that have not been properly sanitized.

### Rule 2: Unsafe Shell Command Construction
Detects the concatenation of strings that are directly passed to shell commands.

```yaml
rules:
  - id: csharp-unsafe-shell-command-construction
    languages: [csharp]
    message: |
      Detected construction of shell command using string concatenation or interpolation with unchecked variables (potential command injection).
    severity: ERROR
    patterns:
      - pattern-either:
          - pattern: |
              var command = $UNTRUSTED_VAR + ...;
              $PROCESS.Start(command);
          - pattern: |
              var command = $"{... $UNTRUSTED_VAR ...}";
              $PROCESS.Start(command);
          - pattern: |
              var command = string.Format(... $UNTRUSTED_VAR ...);
              $PROCESS.Start(command);
      - metavariable-pattern:
          metavariable: $UNTRUSTED_VAR
          pattern-not: $SAFE_VAR
```
This rule looks for unsafe construction of shell commands using string concatenation or interpolation.

### Rule 3: Detecting `ProcessStartInfo.Argument` with User Input
Identifies the use of `ProcessStartInfo.Argument` potentially containing unchecked user input.

```yaml
rules:
  - id: csharp-process-startinfo-unsafe-argument
    languages: [csharp]
    message: Detected potential command injection via ProcessStartInfo.Argument with unchecked user input.
    severity: ERROR
    patterns:
      - pattern: |
            using System.Diagnostics;
            ...
            var startInfo = new ProcessStartInfo();
            startInfo.Arguments = $UNTRUSTED_INPUT;
            Process.Start(startInfo);
      - metavariable-pattern:
          metavariable: $UNTRUSTED_INPUT
          pattern-not: $SAFE_INPUT
```
This rule detects assignment to `ProcessStartInfo.Arguments` with potentially unsafe user data.

### Rule 4: Unsafe Execution of `cmd /c`
Detects potential command injection vulnerabilities in `cmd /c` commands.

```yaml
rules:
  - id: csharp-process-cmd-c-injection 
    languages: [csharp]
    message: Potential command injection vulnerability in cmd /c
    severity: ERROR
    patterns:
      - pattern: |
            using System.Diagnostics;
            ...
            Process.Start("cmd.exe", "/c " + $UNSAFE_COMMAND );
      - metavariable-pattern:
          metavariable: $UNSAFE_COMMAND
          pattern-not: $SAFE_COMMAND
```
This rule identifies use of `cmd /c` with dynamic, unchecked user input.

### Explanation:
These rules use Semgrep's pattern matching and metavariable features to identify possible command injection points where unsanitized user inputs might be used. They are designed to have low false positives by using negative patterns (`pattern-not`) to exclude safe usages. You can further customize these rules based on specific safe patterns you expect in your codebase.
