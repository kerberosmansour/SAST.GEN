To create Semgrep Static Application Security Testing (SAST) rules for detecting Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerabilities in C#, we need to set up rules that cover potential variations of this vulnerability. Here are some example rules, while ensuring minimal false positives and high precision.

### Rule 1: Identify Direct Usage of WebClient

This rule identifies instances where the `WebClient.DownloadString` method is used with a user-controlled URL.

```yaml
rules:
  - id: csharp-webclient-downloadstring
    patterns:
      - pattern: |
          string $URL = $USER_INPUT;
          $WEBCLIENT = new WebClient();
          $WEBCLIENT.DownloadString($URL);
    message: "Potential SSRF vulnerability: WebClient.DownloadString can be exploited if $URL is user-controlled."
    languages: [csharp]
    severity: WARNING
    metadata:
      cwe: "CWE-918: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)"
```

### Rule 2: Identify HttpClient Usage with User-Controlled URL

This rule matches instances where `HttpClient.GetStringAsync` is used with a user-controlled URL, which can potentially lead to SSRF.

```yaml
rules:
  - id: csharp-httpclient-getstringasync
    patterns:
      - pattern: |
          HttpClient $HTTPCLIENT = new HttpClient();
          $HTTPCLIENT.GetStringAsync($URL);
      - metavariable-pattern:
          metavariable: $URL
          patterns:
            - pattern: $USER_INPUT
    message: "Potential SSRF vulnerability: HttpClient.GetStringAsync can be exploited if $URL is user-controlled."
    languages: [csharp]
    severity: WARNING
    metadata:
      cwe: "CWE-918: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)"
```

### Rule 3: Identify WebRequest Usage with User Input in Address

This rule covers cases where `WebRequest.Create` is used with a user-controlled URL.

```yaml
rules:
  - id: csharp-webrequest-create
    patterns:
      - pattern: |
          WebRequest $WEBREQUEST = WebRequest.Create($URL);
      - metavariable-pattern:
          metavariable: $URL
          patterns:
            - pattern: $USER_INPUT
    message: "Potential SSRF vulnerability: WebRequest.Create can be exploited if $URL is user-controlled."
    languages: [csharp]
    severity: WARNING
    metadata:
      cwe: "CWE-918: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)"
```

### Rule 4: Detecting HttpWebRequest with User Input URL

Matching cases where `HttpWebRequest` object is created using a user-controlled URL.

```yaml
rules:
  - id: csharp-httpwebrequest-create
    patterns:
      - pattern: |
          HttpWebRequest $REQUEST = (HttpWebRequest)WebRequest.Create($URL);
      - metavariable-pattern:
          metavariable: $URL
          patterns:
            - pattern: $USER_INPUT
    message: "Potential SSRF vulnerability: HttpWebRequest.Create can be exploited if $URL is user-controlled."
    languages: [csharp]
    severity: WARNING
    metadata:
      cwe: "CWE-918: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)"
```

### Rule 5: Detecting RestClient Usage with Direct URL

This rule covers REST client scenarios where the URL could be user-controlled, considering RestSharp framework.

```yaml
rules:
  - id: csharp-restclient-execute
    patterns:
      - pattern: |
          var $CLIENT = new RestClient($URL);
          var $REQUEST = new RestRequest();
          $CLIENT.Execute($REQUEST);
      - metavariable-pattern:
          metavariable: $URL
          patterns:
            - pattern: $USER_INPUT
    message: "Potential SSRF vulnerability: RestClient.Execute can be exploited if $URL is user-controlled."
    languages: [csharp]
    severity: WARNING
    metadata:
      cwe: "CWE-918: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)"
```
