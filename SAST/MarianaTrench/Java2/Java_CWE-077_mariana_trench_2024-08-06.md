BasedBased on the provided documentation, we can create a set of Mariana Trench Static Application Security Testing (SAST) rules to catch Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection') (CWE-077) in Java. Here's a detailed process:

1. **Identifying Sources**: Sources are typically input points where untrusted data might enter the application. Examples include methods that get data from user input, HTTP requests, database queries, files, etc.

2. **Identifying Sinks**: Sinks are methods that execute system commands with potential command injection risks. Examples include methods from `Runtime` and `ProcessBuilder` classes that execute commands.

3. **Writing Model Generators**:
    - Model generators find methods that match certain constraints and then define those methods as sources or sinks.
    - Constraints can filter methods by name, parent class, annotations, etc.

4. **Writing Rules**:
    - Rules define the relationship between sources and sinks.
    - Rules capture data flow from a source of a particular kind to a sink of a particular kind, triggering an alert when such a path is detected.

Here is a JSON configuration that identifies sources and command injection sinks, and a rule that connects them:

### Model Generator for Sources
```json
{
  "model_generators": [
    {
      "find": "methods",
      "where": [
        { "constraint": "name", "pattern": "getParameter" },
        { "constraint": "parent", "name": "javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest" }
      ],
      "model": {
        "sources": [
          { "kind": "UserInput" }
        ]
      }
    },
    {
      "find": "methods",
      "where": [
        { "constraint": "name", "pattern": "getQuery" },
        { "constraint": "parent", "name": "javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest" }
      ],
      "model": {
        "sources": [
          { "kind": "UserInput" }
        ]
      }
    },
    {
      "find": "methods",
      "where": [
        { "constraint": "name", "pattern": "nextLine" },
        { "constraint": "parent", "name": "java.util.Scanner" }
      ],
      "model": {
        "sources": [
          { "kind": "UserInput" }
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Model Generator for Sinks
```json
{
  "model_generators": [
    {
      "find": "methods",
      "where": [
        { "constraint": "name", "pattern": "exec" },
        { "constraint": "parent", "name": "java.lang.Runtime" }
      ],
      "model": {
        "sinks": [
          { "kind": "CommandExecution", "port": "Argument(0)" }
        ]
      }
    },
    {
      "find": "methods",
      "where": [
        { "constraint": "name", "pattern": "exec" },
        { "constraint": "parent", "name": "java.lang.ProcessBuilder" }
      ],
      "model": {
        "sinks": [
          { "kind": "CommandExecution", "port": "Argument(0)" }
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Rule Definition
```json
{
  "rules": [
    {
      "name": "Command Injection",
      "code": 77,
      "description": "User input flows into command execution",
      "sources": [ "UserInput" ],
      "sinks": [ "CommandExecution" ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Explanation 
- **Sources**:
  - `getParameter`, `getQuery` from `HttpServletRequest`: Frequently used to retrieve user input in web applications.
  - `nextLine` from `Scanner`: Used to directly read user input from the console.

- **Sinks**:
  - `exec` from `Runtime` and `ProcessBuilder`: Key methods that run system commands.

### Steps to Implement
1. **Add Model Generators**:
    - Save the "Model Generator for Sources" and "Model Generator for Sinks" JSON in separate files and place them in the appropriate directory (e.g., `configuration/model-generators`).
    - Update the `default_generator_config.json` to include these new model generators.

2. **Add Rule Configuration**:
    - Update the `rules.json` file to include the new "Command Injection" rule.

3. **Run Analysis**:
    - Use the command line options to point to these configurations and execute the analysis on the Java project.

By following these steps, the Mariana Trench tool will analyze paths from user inputs that could end up invoking system commands, thus identifying potential command injection vulnerabilities.

These rules leverage the flexibility of constraints and models discussed in the documentation    .
