ToTo create effective Mariana Trench Static Application Security Testing (SAST) rules for detecting the "Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference (CWE-611)" vulnerability in Java code, here is a detailed guideline:

### 1. Context Review
Based on the guidelines provided, creating Mariana Trench rules involves defining sources, sinks, and propagation rules along with the conditions under which the vulnerability occurs【4:0†source】 .

### 2. Vulnerability Analysis
**Vulnerability:** Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference (CWE-611)

**Potential Manifestations:**
- Using untrusted XML parsers and enabling external entities (XXE).
- Libraries such as `javax.xml.parsers.DocumentBuilderFactory`, `org.xml.sax.XMLReader`, and similar libraries when their secure features are turned off.

**Common Coding Practices Leading to Vulnerability:**
- Incorrectly configured XML parsers that accept external entity definitions (e.g., `setFeature("http://xml.org/sax/features/external-general-entities", true)`).
- Use of older XML libraries that do not disable external entities by default. 

### 3. Mariana Trench Rule Creation
**Taint Flow Tracking:**
1. **Source Definitions:**
   - Sources for XXE vulnerabilities typically include user-controlled XML data. Identify methods that receive XML payloads, especially from HTTP requests or external sources.

2. **Sink Definitions:**
   - Sinks include XML parsers that do not disable entity resolution. 

3. **Propagation Rules:**
   - Define how taint propagates through the application, particularly how XML data is parsed.

**Example Rule Definitions:**

1. **Source Definitions:**
   ```json
   {
     "model_generators": [
       {
         "find": "methods",
         "where": [
           {
             "constraint": "name_pattern",
             "pattern": "parse.*|loadXML.*" 
           },
           {
             "constraint": "parent",
             "pattern": "some.package.*" 
           }
         ],
         "model": {
           "sources": [
             {
               "kind": "UserControlledXML",
               "port": "Argument(0)" 
             }
           ]
         }
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

2. **Sink Definitions:**
   ```json
   {
     "model_generators": [
       {
         "find": "methods",
         "where": [
           {
             "constraint": "name_pattern",
             "pattern": "newDocumentBuilder|newSAXParser|setFeature" 
           },
           {
             "constraint": "parent",
             "pattern": "javax.xml.parsers.DocumentBuilderFactory|org.xml.sax.XMLReader" 
           }
         ],
         "model": {
           "sinks": [
             {
               "kind": "XMLParserSink",
               "port": "Return" 
             }
           ]
         }
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

3. **Propagation Rules:**
   ```json
   {
     "model_generators": [
       {
         "find": "methods",
         "where": [
           {
             "constraint": "name_pattern",
             "pattern": "transform|convert.*" 
           },
           {
             "constraint": "parent",
             "pattern": "some.package.*"
           }
         ],
         "model": {
           "propagation": [
             {
               "input": "Argument(0)",
               "output": "Return" 
             }
           ]
         }
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

4. **Full Rule:**
   ```json
   {
     "name": "XXE Import Mitigation",
     "code": 1001,
     "description": "Detects potential XXE vulnerabilities due to improper XML parsing configurations",
     "sources": [
       "UserControlledXML"
     ],
     "sinks": [
       "XMLParserSink"
     ],
     "transforms": [
       "XMLConversion" 
     ]
   }
   ```

### 4. Testing and Validation
**Test Cases:**
1. Valid user-controlled XML input passing through a vulnerable parser configuration.
2. Ensure tainted data flows from sources to sinks.

**Testing Approach:**
1. **Static Code Analysis:** Leverage Mariana Trench SAST to scan codebases containing intentional vulnerable patterns and measure detection.
2. **Audit tool Output:** Review the findings manually to ensure low false positives and false negatives.
3. **Regression Testing:** Include unit tests confirming that the rules catch past bugs and do not trigger on secure patterns.

**Console Usage:**
- Use the Mariana Trench query console to load and test these rules across diverse codebases. Validate the coverage and accuracy by examining real and synthetic code patterns【4:0†source】 .

This approach should provide a robust set of rules to minimize both false positives and false negatives for XML External Entity (XXE) vulnerabilities in Java.
