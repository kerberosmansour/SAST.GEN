ToTo generate a set of Semgrep SAST rules for detecting variations of the Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability (CWE-079) in JavaScript, we can follow the pattern syntax and rule-writing principles outlined in your provided document. Here’s an example Semgrep rule that targets this vulnerability across popular JavaScript frameworks:

### Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Detection in JavaScript

#### Rule for Generic JavaScript XSS
```yaml
rules:
  - id: xss-detection-generic
    message: "Potential Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability"
    languages: [javascript]
    severity: ERROR
    patterns:
      - pattern-either:
          - pattern: |
              document.write($X)
          - pattern: |
              document.writeln($X)
          - pattern: |
              $NODE.innerHTML = $X
          - pattern: |
              $NODE.outerHTML = $X
          - pattern: |
              $NODE.insertAdjacentHTML(..., $X)
          - pattern: |
              eval($X)
          - pattern: |
              setTimeout($X, ...)
          - pattern: |
              setInterval($X, ...)
    metadata:
      cwe: "CWE-079"
      owasp: "A7:2017- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
      description: "Detects direct usage of unsafe APIs which may lead to XSS attacks."
```

#### Rule for React (JSX) XSS
```yaml
rules:
  - id: xss-detection-react
    message: "Potential Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in React"
    languages: [javascript, typescript]
    severity: ERROR
    patterns:
      - pattern-either:
          - pattern: |
              <$ELEMENT dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: $X }} />
          - pattern: |
              $ELEMENT.props.dangerouslySetInnerHTML = { __html: $X }
    metadata:
      cwe: "CWE-079"
      owasp: "A7:2017- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
      description: "Detects usage of 'dangerouslySetInnerHTML' in React applications, which may lead to XSS attacks."
```

#### Rule for Angular XSS
```yaml
rules:
  - id: xss-detection-angular
    message: "Potential Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Angular"
    languages: [typescript]
    severity: ERROR
    patterns:
      - pattern-either:
          - pattern: |
              this.domSanitizer.bypassSecurityTrustHtml($X)
          - pattern: |
              this.domSanitizer.bypassSecurityTrustResourceUrl($X)
    metadata:
      cwe: "CWE-079"
      owasp: "A7:2017- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
      description: "Detects unsafe usage of Angular's bypassSecurityTrust* APIs, which may lead to XSS attacks."
```

These rules have been constructed by leveraging pattern examples, ellipsis operators for generic matching, and custom message and metadata settings as outlined in the provided document for Semgrep rules【4:0†source】【4:1†source】【4:2†source】【4:5†source】【4:7†source】【4:8†source】.

**Note:** These rules are designed to detect common XSS patterns and may need customization based on specific project requirements.
