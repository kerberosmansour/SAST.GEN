ToTo create Semgrep SAST rules for identifying occurrences of "Uncontrolled Resource Consumption (CWE-400)" in JavaScript, we need to capture instances where the code might perform expensive operations repeatedly or without controls. We will use Semgrepâ€™s pattern syntax and capabilities to handle variations across popular JavaScript frameworks.

Here's a set of Semgrep rules designed to detect variations of this vulnerability:

```yaml
rules:
  - id: detect-recursive-calls
    languages: [javascript, typescript]
    message: "Potential uncontrolled resource consumption due to recursive calls"
    severity: ERROR
    patterns:
      - pattern: |
          function $FUNC(...) {
            ...
            $FUNC(...)
            ...
          }
      - pattern-not: |
          function $FUNC(...) {
            if (...) {
              return ...;
            }
            $FUNC(...)
          }

  - id: detect-infinite-loops
    languages: [javascript, typescript]
    message: "Potential infinite loop causing uncontrolled resource consumption"
    severity: ERROR
    patterns:
      - pattern: |
          while (true) {
            ...
          }
      - pattern: |
          for (;;) {
            ...
          }

  - id: detect-uncontrolled-iterations
    languages: [javascript, typescript]
    message: "Uncontrolled resource consumption due to excessive iterations"
    severity: ERROR
    patterns:
      - pattern: |
          for (let $VAR = 0; $VAR < $EXPR; $VAR++) {
            ...
          }
      - metavariable-comparison:
          metavariable: $EXPR
          comparison: $EXPR > 10000

  - id: detect-no-rate-limit-axios
    languages: [javascript, typescript]
    message: "Uncontrolled resource consumption due to missing rate limiting with axios"
    severity: ERROR
    patterns:
      - pattern: |
          axios.get($URL).then($RESPONSE => {
            ...
            axios.get($URL)
            ...
          })

  - id: detect-no-throttle-debounce
    languages: [javascript, typescript]
    message: "Potential uncontrolled resource consumption due to missing throttle/debounce"
    severity: WARNING
    patterns:
      - pattern: |
          $OBJ.$METHOD = function(...) {
            ...
            window.addEventListener($EVENT, $FUNC)
            ...
          }
      - pattern-not: |
          $OBJ.$METHOD = function(...) {
            ...
            window.addEventListener($EVENT, _.throttle($FUNC, ...))
            ...
          }
      - pattern-not: |
          $OBJ.$METHOD = function(...) {
            ...
            window.addEventListener($EVENT, _.debounce($FUNC, ...))
            ...
          }
```

### Explanation:
1. **detect-recursive-calls**: Detects functions where there is a potential for uncontrolled recursive calls without any base case to terminate the recursion.
2. **detect-infinite-loops**: Catches common cases of infinite loops using `while (true)` and `for (;;)` patterns.
3. **detect-uncontrolled-iterations**: Flags `for` loops iterating for a very high number of times, which could cause performance issues.
4. **detect-no-rate-limit-axios**: Specifically looks for axios HTTP requests in promise chains without implementing any form of rate limiting.
5. **detect-no-throttle-debounce**: Checks for event listeners potentially causing high-frequency function calls without throttling or debouncing.

These rules cover various scenarios and frameworks, ensuring a broad capture of potential uncontrolled resource consumption issues.
