To write effective Semgrep SAST rules for detecting "Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an Expression Language Statement (Expression Language Injection) (CWE-917)" in C#, we can leverage concepts such as pattern matching, metavariables, and `metavariable-pattern`.

Below, I'll create a set of Semgrep rules that aim to identify common patterns and variations of this vulnerability in popular C# frameworks.

### Semgrep Rule 1: Detecting Direct Usage of Expression Language Injection

```yaml
rules:
  - id: csharp-expression-language-injection
    patterns:
      - pattern-either:
          - pattern: |
              $OBJ.DataBind()
          - pattern: |
              ${{ }/*some pattern representing EL injection*/}
    languages: [csharp]
    severity: ERROR
    message: "Potential Expression Language Injection detected in $OBJ.DataBind()."
```

### Semgrep Rule 2: Detecting Expression Language Injection via Input 

```yaml
rules:
  - id: csharp-el-injection-from-input
    patterns:
      - pattern: |
          $VAR = $INPUT
      - pattern: |
          $OBJ.DataBind()
          ...
          $VAR
    languages: [csharp]
    severity: ERROR
    message: "Potential Expression Language Injection detected from user input in $VAR."
```

### Semgrep Rule 3: Detecting Expression Language Injection in ASP.NET

```yaml
rules:
  - id: csharp-el-injection-aspnet
    patterns:
      - pattern-either:
          - pattern: |
              <asp:TextBox runat="server" Text='<%# $TEXT %>' ></asp:TextBox>
          - pattern: |
              <asp:Label runat="server" Text='<%# $TEXT %>' ></asp:Label>
    languages: [csharp]
    severity: ERROR
    message: "Potential Expression Language Injection detected in ASP.NET control."
```

### Semgrep Rule 4: Detecting Expression Language Injection in Razor Views

```yaml
rules:
  - id: csharp-el-injection-razor-views
    patterns:
      - pattern-either:
          - pattern: |
              @Html.Raw($EXPR)
          - pattern: |
              @{$EXPR}
    languages: [csharp]
    severity: ERROR
    message: "Potential Expression Language Injection detected in Razor views with @Html.Raw or inline code blocks."
```

### Explanation

1. **Semgrep Rule 1: Direct Usage**:
   - This rule flags direct usage of `$OBJ.DataBind()` and similar patterns that could represent expression language injections.
   
2. **Semgrep Rule 2: From Input**:
   - This rule flags scenarios where a variable `$VAR` is assigned from some input source (e.g., request values), and later used in a `.DataBind()` method.

3. **Semgrep Rule 3: ASP.NET Controls**:
   - This rule checks for potential EL injection in ASP.NET controls like `asp:TextBox` and `asp:Label` where user inputs or expressions are used for the `Text` property.

4. **Semgrep Rule 4: Razor Views**:
   - This rule detects usage of `@Html.Raw` or direct @{} code blocks in Razor views that might be vulnerable to EL injection.

### Validation & Testing

Semgrep rules can be tested and refined using the Semgrep Playground . Adjust the rules iteratively to minimize false positives by refining patterns and contexts.

### Tips for Optimization

1. **Ellipsis**: Use `...` to abstract away irrelevant code parts to focus on the potential vulnerable points .
2. **Metavariables**: Use metavariables to capture and refine matching patterns more dynamically【4:0†source】.
3. **Patterns and Polyglot Files**: Use a combination of patterns for different contexts, especially useful in polyglot scenarios  .

Feel free to iterate on these rules and adjust according to the specific application needs and the frameworks in use.
