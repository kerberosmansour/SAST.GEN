Based on the provided information and extracted sections on writing Semgrep rules, here are some examples of how to write Semgrep SAST rules to detect Integer Overflow or Wraparound (CWE-190) vulnerabilities in C#:

### Semgrep Rule for Integer Overflow or Wraparound (CWE-190) in C#

1. **Detecting Addition Overflow**:

```yaml
rules:
  - id: int-overflow-addition
    languages: [csharp]
    message: "Potential integer overflow in addition operation"
    severity: ERROR
    patterns:
      - pattern: |
          int $X = $Y + $Z
      - metavariable-pattern:
          metavariable: $Y
          comparison: $Y + $Z < $Y
```

This rule will detect instances where integer addition could result in overflow by checking if the value after addition is less than one of the addends, which would indicate an overflow condition.

2. **Detecting Multiplication Overflow**:

```yaml
rules:
  - id: int-overflow-multiplication
    languages: [csharp]
    message: "Potential integer overflow in multiplication operation"
    severity: ERROR
    patterns:
      - pattern: |
          int $X = $Y * $Z
      - metavariable-pattern:
          metavariable: $Y
          comparison: $Y * $Z / $Z != $Y
```

This rule will detect multiplication overflow by ensuring that dividing the product by one of the operands retrieves the original operand.

3. **Detecting Subtraction Underflow**:

```yaml
rules:
  - id: int-underflow-subtraction
    languages: [csharp]
    message: "Potential integer underflow in subtraction operation"
    severity: ERROR
    patterns:
      - pattern: |
          int $X = $Y - $Z
      - metavariable-pattern:
          metavariable: $Y
          comparison: $Y - $Z > $Y
```

This rule will detect instances where integer subtraction could result in underflow by checking if the value after subtraction is greater than the minuend, indicating an underflow condition.

4. **Detecting Integer Overflow in Loops**:

```yaml
rules:
  - id: int-overflow-loop
    languages: [csharp]
    message: "Potential integer overflow in loop increment"
    severity: ERROR
    patterns:
      - pattern: |
          for (int $I = 0; $I < $X; $I++)
      - metavariable-pattern:
          metavariable: $I
          comparison: $I + 1 < $I
```

This rule looks for potential overflow in loop increments by checking if incrementing a loop variable results in a value that is less than itself, indicating an overflow.

5. **Complex Integer Operations with Method Calls**:

```yaml
rules:
  - id: int-overflow-method-calls
    languages: [csharp]
    message: "Potential integer overflow with method calls"
    severity: ERROR
    patterns:
      - pattern: $X = $FUNC1($Y) + $FUNC2($Z)
      - metavariable-pattern:
          metavariable: $Y
          comparison: $FUNC1($Y) + $FUNC2($Z) < $FUNC1($Y)
```

This rule will detect potential overflows involving method calls by analyzing expressions where the sum of the results of two method calls could result in an integer overflow.

### Conclusion
These examples cover various scenarios where Integer Overflow or Wraparound vulnerabilities could occur. Adjustments might be needed to fit specific frameworks or coding standards in C# projects. To ensure high accuracy, regularly test and validate these rules with real code samples to minimize false positives and negatives.

For more advanced techniques and optimization strategies, consider analyzing Semgrep documentation and applying more complex matching patterns like `pattern-either`, `pattern-inside`, or `metavariable-pattern` for more precise results     .
