Here's how you can generate a set of Semgrep SAST rules for detecting Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) (CWE-352) in C#.

### Rule 1: Detecting Missing Anti-Forgery Tokens in ASP.NET Core Controllers

This rule detects cases where controllers do not include the `[ValidateAntiForgeryToken]` attribute, which is used to prevent CSRF attacks in ASP.NET Core.

```yaml
rules:
  - id: aspnetcore-missing-anti-forgery-token
    languages: [csharp]
    message: "Action does not have an anti-forgery token validation, which may lead to CSRF vulnerabilities."
    patterns:
      - pattern-inside: |
          public class $CONTROLLER : Controller
      - pattern: |
          public IActionResult $ACTION(...){...}
      - pattern-not: |
          [ValidateAntiForgeryToken]
          public IActionResult $ACTION(...){...}
    severity: WARNING
```

### Rule 2: Ensure `HttpPost` Methods Require Anti-Forgery Token

This rule ensures that methods in `HttpPost` do not miss the `[ValidateAntiForgeryToken]` attribute in ASP.NET.

```yaml
rules:
  - id: aspnetcore-http-post-missing-anti-forgery-token
    languages: [csharp]
    message: "HttpPost action without anti-forgery token validation can lead to CSRF vulnerabilities."
    patterns:
      - pattern-inside: |
          public class $CONTROLLER : Controller
      - pattern: |
          [HttpPost]
          public IActionResult $ACTION(...){...}
      - pattern-not: |
          [ValidateAntiForgeryToken]
          [HttpPost]
          public IActionResult $ACTION(...){...}
    severity: ERROR
```

### Rule 3: Flagging Actions Using FormCollection Without Anti-Forgery Token

This rule flags actions that accept `FormCollection` input without validating anti-forgery tokens.

```yaml
rules:
  - id: aspnetcore-formcollection-missing-anti-forgery-token
    languages: [csharp]
    message: "Action accepting FormCollection without anti-forgery validation can lead to CSRF vulnerabilities."
    patterns:
      - pattern-inside: |
          public class $CONTROLLER : Controller
      - pattern: |
          public IActionResult $ACTION(FormCollection $FORM) {...}
      - pattern-not: |
          [ValidateAntiForgeryToken]
          public IActionResult $ACTION(FormCollection $FORM) {...}
    severity: ERROR
```

### Considerations and Variations

1. **Framework Specifics**: Focus on ASP.NET Core MVC and ASP.NET Web Forms, as they are popularly used frameworks where CSRF is a common risk.
2. **Metavariables and Ellipses**: Use metavariables to capture controller and action names. The ellipsis (`...`) operator can help match a variable number of characters, statements, or parameters to cover more variations.
3. **Pattern Combinations**: Use the `pattern-inside` operator to specify contexts under which the patterns should be matched or `pattern-not` to exclude valid cases.

You can test these rules using the Semgrep Playground to ensure they detect CSRF risks without resulting in high false positives    .
