Based on the provided details and the extracted information regarding writing Semgrep rules, here is a set of Semgrep SAST rules tailored to identify the "Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling (CWE-770)" vulnerability in C# code. These rules should cover variations in popular C# frameworks such as ASP.NET.

### Example Semgrep Rule for CWE-770 in C#:

```yaml
rules:
  - id: csharp-cwe-770-unlimited-allocation
    patterns:
      - pattern-either:
        # Detect unbounded allocation of managed resources
        - pattern: |
            var $BUFFER = new byte[$SIZE];
        - pattern: |
            var $BUFFER = new List<$TYPE>[$SIZE];
    message: "Potential unbounded allocation without limits or throttling (CWE-770)"
    severity: WARNING
    languages: [csharp]

  - id: csharp-cwe-770-unlimited-loop-allocation
    patterns:
      # Detect allocations within loops that can lead to unbounded resource allocation
      - pattern: |
          for (...) {
            var $BUFFER = new byte[$SIZE];
          }
      - pattern: |
          foreach (...) {
            var $BUFFER = new List<$TYPE>[$SIZE];
          }
      - pattern: |
          while (...) {
            var $BUFFER = new byte[$SIZE];
          }
      message: "Allocation within a loop potentially leading to unbounded resource allocation (CWE-770)"
      severity: WARNING
      languages: [csharp]

  - id: csharp-cwe-770-unlimiting-endpoint-allocation
    patterns:
      # Detect unthrottled endpoint handling requests leading to unbounded resource allocation
      - pattern: |
          public IActionResult $METHOD(...) {
            var $BUFFER = new byte[$SIZE];
            ...
            return Ok(...);
          }
    message: "Potentially unbounded allocation of resources in an endpoint handler without limits or throttling (CWE-770)"
    severity: WARNING
    languages: [csharp]
    metadata:
      category: CWE-770
```

### Explanation of the Rules:
1. **Unbounded Allocation Detection:**
   - Patterns that match arrays or lists being allocated with sizes that can be dynamically set, potentially causing large allocations if not handled properly.

2. **Allocation within Loops:**
   - Patterns that match allocations inside `for`, `foreach`, or `while` loops, which can quickly lead to unbounded resource usage if loops are not correctly managed or limited.

3. **Endpoint Handler Allocations:**
   - Patterns designed to catch allocations within ASP.NET endpoint handlers (patterns such as `IActionResult`), which might cause excessive resource use if the endpoint is hit with many requests and no throttling or limiting is in place.

### Potential Enhancements:
You can refine these patterns further by adding context or additional checks if needed to reduce false positives. Also, leveraging `metavariable-pattern` and `pattern-not-inside` could help exclude known safe patterns or limit checks to certain conditions.
