Based on the provided examples and methodologies for writing Semgrep rules, here is a set of Semgrep SAST rules aimed at detecting "Improper Certificate Validation (CWE-295)" vulnerabilities in C#. These rules account for common variations in popular frameworks.

### Rule 1: Detecting `ServicePointManager.ServerCertificateValidationCallback` with Improper Validation
This rule aims to detect when `ServerCertificateValidationCallback` is set improperly leading to insecure certificate validation.

```yaml
rules:
  - id: servercert-validation
    languages:
      - csharp
    message: Improper Certificate Validation via ServicePointManager.ServerCertificateValidationCallback
    severity: ERROR
    patterns:
      - pattern: |
          ServicePointManager.ServerCertificateValidationCallback = delegate { return true; };
      - pattern: |
          ServicePointManager.ServerCertificateValidationCallback += (sender, cert, chain, sslPolicyErrors) => true;
      - pattern: |
          ServicePointManager.ServerCertificateValidationCallback = delegate(object sender,
                                                                               X509Certificate cert, 
                                                                               X509Chain chain, 
                                                                               SslPolicyErrors sslPolicyErrors) { return true; };
```

### Rule 2: Detecting `HttpClientHandler.ServerCertificateCustomValidationCallback` with Improper Validation
This rule targets instances where `HttpClientHandler.ServerCertificateCustomValidationCallback` is improperly assigned, compromising certificate validation.

```yaml
rules:
  - id: httpclienthandler-validation
    languages:
      - csharp
    message: Improper Certificate Validation via HttpClientHandler.ServerCertificateCustomValidationCallback
    severity: ERROR
    patterns:
      - pattern: |
          var $H = new HttpClientHandler();
          $H.ServerCertificateCustomValidationCallback = (message, cert, chain, sslPolicyErrors) => true;
      - pattern: |
          var $H = new HttpClientHandler {
              ServerCertificateCustomValidationCallback = (message, cert, chain, sslPolicyErrors) => true
          };
```

### Rule 3: Detecting `RemoteCertificateValidationCallback` Improperly Implemented
This rule identifies unsafe implementations of `RemoteCertificateValidationCallback`, where the validation function always returns true.

```yaml
rules:
  - id: remotecert-validation
    languages:
      - csharp
    message: Improper Certificate Validation via RemoteCertificateValidationCallback
    severity: ERROR
    patterns:
      - pattern: |
          RemoteCertificateValidationCallback $RC = delegate { return true; };
      - pattern: |
          RemoteCertificateValidationCallback $RC = (sender, cert, chain, sslPolicyErrors) => true;
```

### Rule 4: Detecting Direct Assignment of `X509Certificate2.CreateFromSignedFile` without Validation
This rule checks for the use of `X509Certificate2.CreateFromSignedFile` to create certificates without validation.

```yaml
rules:
  - id: x509cert-createfromsignedfile
    languages:
      - csharp
    message: Use of X509Certificate2.CreateFromSignedFile without validation
    severity: WARNING
    patterns:
      - pattern: |
          var $Cert = X509Certificate2.CreateFromSignedFile($path);
```

### Rule 5: Detecting `SslStream.AuthenticateAsClient` with Insecure Validation Settings
Detects instances where `SslStream.AuthenticateAsClient` is used with insecure parameters.

```yaml
rules:
  - id: sslstream-authenticateasclient
    languages:
      - csharp
    message: Insecure SslStream.AuthenticateAsClient settings
    severity: ERROR
    patterns:
      - pattern: |
          var $sslStream = new SslStream($stream, false, (sender, certificate, chain, sslPolicyErrors) => true);
      - pattern: |
          $sslStream.AuthenticateAsClient($targetHost, $clientCertificates, $enabledSslProtocols, false);
```

### Conclusion
This set of rules targets common patterns where improper certificate validation can occur in C#. These rules focus on ensuring that misconfigurations, particularly those leading to always allowing certificates irrespective of their validity, are caught. Optimizing these rules to maintain high false negative detection rates while minimizing false positives is essential, applying specific patterns and context, such as using the `pattern`, `patterns`, and `pattern-not` constructs effectively【4:0†source】     .
