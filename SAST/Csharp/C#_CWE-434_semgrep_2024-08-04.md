###### Semgrep Rule for Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type (CWE-434) in C#

This set of Semgrep rules aims to identify situations where files of dangerous types are uploaded without proper restriction in C# applications. The unvalidated file uploads can lead to a variety of vulnerabilities including Remote Code Execution (RCE). These rules cover variations commonly seen across popular C# frameworks such as ASP.NET.

#### Rule 1: Detecting Direct File Uploads

```yaml
rules:
  - id: csharp-unrestricted-file-upload
    patterns:
      - pattern: |
          public IActionResult Upload(IFormFile $FILE)
          {
              ...
              $FILE.CopyTo(...);
              ...
          }
      - pattern-inside: |
          if (... !FileCheck($FILE) ...)
          {
              $UPLOAD_STATEMENT;
          }
    message: Detected an unrestricted file upload. Ensure only safe file types are allowed.
    languages: [csharp]
    severity: ERROR
```

#### Rule 2: Checking Insufficient File Type Validation

```yaml
rules:
  - id: csharp-insufficient-file-type-validation
    patterns:
      - pattern-either:
          - pattern: |
              if ($FILE.ContentType == ...)
          - pattern: |
              if ($FILE.FileName.EndsWith("..."))
    message: Detected insufficient file type validation in file upload.
    languages: [csharp]
    severity: WARNING
```

#### Rule 3: Detecting Dangerous File Type Upload

```yaml
rules:
  - id: csharp-dangerous-file-type-detected
    patterns:
      - pattern: |
          if ($FILE.FileName.EndsWith(".exe") || $FILE.FileName.EndsWith(".js") || ...)
      - pattern-either:
          - pattern: |
              if (!FileCheck($FILE.FileName))
    message: Detected upload of potentially dangerous file types. Ensure proper validation.
    languages: [csharp]
    severity: WARNING
```

#### Rule 4: Detecting Lack of Upload Directory Restrictions

```yaml
rules:
  - id: csharp-upload-directory-restriction-missing
    pattern: |
        Directory.CreateDirectory(...);
        var path = Path.Combine(uploadFolder, $FILE.FileName);
        using (var stream = new FileStream(path, FileMode.Create))
        {
            ...
        }
    message: Missing upload directory restrictions. Ensure uploads are saved in a safe directory.
    languages: [csharp]
    severity: ERROR
```

#### Rule 5: Handling Uploaded Files Securely

```yaml
rules:
  - id: csharp-secure-file-handling
    patterns:
      - pattern: |
          var $FILE = Request.Form.Files[...];
          if (... $FILE == null ...)
          {
              ...
          }
      - pattern-inside: |
          if (!IsValidType($FILE))
          {
              $UPLOAD_STATEMENT;
          }
    message: Uploaded files are not securely handled or validated.
    languages: [csharp]
    severity: ERROR
```

### Rule Explanations
1. **Detecting Direct File Uploads**:
   - Identifies direct file uploads in an ASP.NET controller without any checks.
   - Example code:
     ```csharp
     public IActionResult Upload(IFormFile file)
     {
         file.CopyTo(stream);
     }
     ```

2. **Checking Insufficient File Type Validation**:
   - Flags checks that only match against a file extension or MIME type, which can be easily bypassed.
   - Example code:
     ```csharp
     if (file.ContentType == "application/zip")
     ...
     if (file.FileName.EndsWith(".zip"))
     ...
     ```

3. **Detecting Dangerous File Type Upload**:
   - Ensures proper validation against dangerous file types.
   - Example code:
     ```csharp
     if (file.FileName.EndsWith(".exe") || file.FileName.EndsWith(".js"))
     ```

4. **Detecting Lack of Upload Directory Restrictions**:
   - Verifies that uploads are restricted to safe directories by ensuring directories are properly controlled.
   - Example code:
     ```csharp
     Directory.CreateDirectory(...);
     var path = Path.Combine(uploadFolder, file.FileName);
     ```

5. **Handling Uploaded Files Securely**:
   - Ensures that file uploads are followed by proper handling and validation functions.
   - Example code:
     ```csharp
     var file = Request.Form.Files[0];
     if (file == null)
     ...
     if (!IsValidType(file))
     ...
     ```

These rules combine multiple patterns and contexts to reduce false positives while effectively identifying possible unrestricted file upload vulnerabilities. For more advanced rule creation, refer to the Semgrep documentation and tutorials available on the Semgrep website    .
