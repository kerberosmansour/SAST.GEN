To create a Semgrep SAST rule for "Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')" (CWE-078) in C#, let's use patterns and techniques to reduce false positives and false negatives. Here’s a guide based on the information derived from the provided document:

### Writing Custom Semgrep Rules

#### Key Concepts

1. **Patterns**: Use specific patterns to match code snippets that exhibit the vulnerability.
2. **Metavariables**: Use metavariables to capture and refer to parts of the matched patterns.
3. **Ellipses (`...`)**: This can be used to match zero or more arguments, statements, or expressions.
4. **Pattern Inside/Not Inside**: Specify contexts where patterns should or should not be matched.

### Semgrep Rule Example for CWE-078 (OS Command Injection) in C#

1. **Detecting Direct Execution of Commands with `Process.Start`**:

```yaml
rules:
  - id: csharp-os-command-injection
    languages: [csharp]
    message: "Potential OS Command Injection detected"
    severity: ERROR
    patterns:
      - pattern: |
          Process.Start($COMMAND)
          where any(
            $COMMAND == $INJECTABLE_VAR + ...
            $COMMAND == $USER_INPUT
          )
    metadata:
      cwe: CWE-078
      owasp: A1: Injection
    fix: "Validate user inputs and avoid direct usage of user-controlled variables in OS commands."
```

2. **Detecting Execution via `cmd.exe` or `bash`**:

```yaml
rules:
  - id: csharp-os-command-injection-bash-cmd
    languages: [csharp]
    message: "Potential OS Command Injection via shell detected"
    severity: ERROR
    patterns:
      - pattern: |
          Process.Start("cmd.exe", "/C " + $COMMAND)
          where any(
            $COMMAND == $INJECTABLE_VAR + ...
            $COMMAND == $USER_INPUT
          )
      - pattern: |
          Process.Start("bash", "-c " + $COMMAND)
          where any(
            $COMMAND == $INJECTABLE_VAR + ...
            $COMMAND == $USER_INPUT
          )
    metadata:
      cwe: CWE-078
      owasp: A1: Injection
    fix: "Validate user inputs and avoid direct usage of user-controlled variables in OS commands."
```

3. **Detecting `ProcessStartInfo` with URL or User Input**:

```yaml
rules:
  - id: csharp-os-command-injection-startinfo
    languages: [csharp]
    message: "Potential OS Command Injection via ProcessStartInfo detected"
    severity: ERROR
    patterns:
      - pattern: |
          new ProcessStartInfo($COMMAND)
          {
            Arguments = $ARGS,
            // Match if any of the arguments are user controlled directly or through concatenation
            Arguments == $INJECTABLE_ARG + ...
            Arguments == $USER_INPUT_ARG
          }
    metadata:
      cwe: CWE-078
      owasp: A1: Injection
    fix: "Validate user inputs and avoid direct usage of user-controlled arguments in OS commands."
```

### Explanation of Rules

1. **Main Concepts**:
   - **Pattern Matching**: Utilize patterns to identify cases where OS commands are constructed using potentially tainted input variables.
   - **Metavariable Use**: `$COMMAND`, `$INJECTABLE_VAR`, and `$USER_INPUT` metavariables are placeholders for detected command variable parts.
   - **Conditional Checks**: Patterns ensure checks are applied where user inputs potentially influence command execution directly.

2. **Code Contexts**:
   - Rules focus on matching C# code where potentially tainted variables are employed in constructing OS commands or arguments for `Process.Start`, which interacts with the underlying OS.

### Creation and Execution

Store these rules in YAML files and execute them using Semgrep CLI:

```sh
semgrep --config /path/to/your_rules.yaml /path/to/analyze
```

In this way, you can effectively capture command injection vulnerabilities with high accuracy in C# codebases using Semgrep's powerful pattern matching capabilities.
