#### Generating Semgrep SAST Rules for SQL Injection in C#

Based on the information provided in your `Semgrep.output.md` file, here are Semgrep rules for detecting potential SQL Injection vulnerabilities in C# code. These rules aim to cover variations and common frameworks while ensuring high detection rates and low false positives.

### Rule 1: Detect SQL Commands using Raw Queries

```yaml
rules:
- id: csharp-sql-injection-raw-query
  patterns:
    - pattern: "new SqlCommand($QUERY, $CONN)"
    - metavariable-pattern:
        metavariable: $QUERY
        pattern-not: "string"
  message: "Possible SQL Injection vulnerability: avoid using raw SQL queries."
  severity: ERROR
  languages: [csharp]
  metadata:
    cwe: "CWE-089"
    owasp: "A1: Injection"
```

### Rule 2: Detect SQL Commands using String Concatenation

```yaml
rules:
- id: csharp-sql-injection-string-concat
  patterns:
    - pattern: "new SqlCommand(\"...\" + $VARIABLE + \"...\", $CONN)"
  message: "Possible SQL Injection vulnerability: avoid concatenating SQL queries."
  severity: ERROR
  languages: [csharp]
  metadata:
    cwe: "CWE-089"
    owasp: "A1: Injection"
```

### Rule 3: Detect Usage of Dapper with Raw SQL

```yaml
rules:
- id: csharp-sql-injection-dapper-raw
  patterns:
    - pattern: "connection.Query<$TYPE>(\"...\")"
    - metavariable-pattern:
        metavariable: "$TYPE"
        pattern-not: "SqlMapper.ICustomQueryParameter"
  message: "Possible SQL Injection vulnerability: avoid using raw SQL with Dapper."
  severity: ERROR
  languages: [csharp]
  metadata:
    cwe: "CWE-089"
    owasp: "A1: Injection"
```

### Rule 4: Tainted Data Flow into SQL Queries

```yaml
rules:
- id: csharp-sql-injection-tainted-flow
  patterns:
    - pattern-inside: |
        {
          var $VAR = ...;
          new SqlCommand(... + $VAR + ...);
        }
  message: "Possible SQL Injection vulnerability: tainted data is flowing into SQL query."
  severity: ERROR
  languages: [csharp]
  metadata:
    cwe: "CWE-089"
    owasp: "A1: Injection"
```

### Rule 5: Using Entity Framework with Raw SQL

```yaml
rules:
- id: csharp-sql-injection-ef-raw
  patterns:
    - pattern: "$DB.Database.ExecuteSqlCommand(\"...\")"
  message: "Possible SQL Injection vulnerability: avoid using raw SQL with Entity Framework."
  severity: ERROR
  languages: [csharp]
  metadata:
    cwe: "CWE-089"
    owasp: "A1: Injection"
```

### Explanation and Best Practices

1. **Minimize Use of Metavariables**: By using specific patterns and minimizing metavariables, we improve rule accuracy and performance.
2. **Focused Matching**: These rules specifically target high-risk operations and common frameworks in C# such as raw SQL commands, string concatenation, Dapper, and Entity Framework【4:0†source】   .
3. **Test with Real-World Code**: Ensure to test these rules with actual codebases to refine and adjust for high detection accuracy and minimal false positives .

These rules should serve as a robust starting point to detect SQL Injection vulnerabilities effectively in C#.
