BasedBased on the provided context for writing Semgrep SAST rules, here is a custom rule designed to detect "Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection') (CWE-078)" in Java. This rule considers different variations that could occur in popular frameworks.

### Semgrep Rule for OS Command Injection in Java

```yaml
rules:
  - id: java-os-command-injection
    patterns:
      - pattern-either:
        # Detects common exec methods in Java
        - pattern: |
            Process $P = Runtime.getRuntime().exec($CMD);
        - pattern: |
            Process $P = $INSTANCE.exec($CMD);
        - pattern: |
            $PROCESS_BUILDER = new ProcessBuilder($ARGS...);
    message: "Possible OS command injection detected. Ensure that $CMD or $ARGS is properly sanitized."
    severity: ERROR
    languages: [java]
    metadata:
      cwe: "CWE-078"
      references:
        - "https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/78.html"
      # Describing variations in popular frameworks
      frameworks:
        - name: "Spring"
          description: "Spring applications might include methods where user input is passed directly to exec or ProcessBuilder without validation."
        - name: "Struts"
          description: "Struts applications often use similar patterns with ProcessBuilder or Runtime.getRuntime()."
    examples:
      - code: |
          import java.io.IOException;

          public class Example {
              public void vulnerableMethod(String userInput) throws IOException {
                  String[] cmd = {"/bin/sh", "-c", userInput};
                  ProcessBuilder pb = new ProcessBuilder(cmd);
                  pb.start();
              }
          }
        message: "Detected code triggering OS Command Injection."
        severity: ERROR
        # Adjust the pattern to match more specific cases in different scenarios
```

#### Explanation:
- **patterns**: Uses pattern-either to cover different variations of command execution methods in Java (Runtime.exec and ProcessBuilder).
- **message**: Alerts about the potential for OS command injection and advises validation.
- **severity**: Set to `ERROR` due to the high severity of command injection vulnerabilities.
- **languages**: Target set to Java.
- **metadata**: Includes the specific CWE and references for further context.

This rule will help flag instances in Java code where user input is passed directly to command execution methods without proper sanitization, which could lead to OS command injection vulnerabilities.

To optimize and further tune this rule, consider incorporating real application scenarios and testing across different Java projects to minimize false positives and ensure comprehensive coverage    .
