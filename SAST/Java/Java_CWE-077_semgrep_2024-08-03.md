HereHere is a Semgrep rule for detecting Command Injection (CWE-077) vulnerabilities in Java, considering various popular frameworks and patterns that might be used:

```yaml
rules:
  - id: java-command-injection
    languages: [java]
    message: "Possible Command Injection (CWE-077)"
    severity: ERROR
    patterns:
      - pattern: $PROC = Runtime.getRuntime().exec($CMD)
      - pattern: $PROC = Runtime.getRuntime().exec($CMD, ...)
      - pattern: $PROC = new ProcessBuilder($CMDS...).start()
      - pattern: new ProcessBuilder($CMDS...).start()
      - pattern: Runtime.getRuntime().exec($CMD)
      - pattern: Runtime.getRuntime().exec($CMD, ...)
    metavariable-regex:
      CMD: "...(:?[`|&;'])..."
      CMDS: "...(:?[`|&;'])..."
    message: |
      Potential command injection detected. Avoid using Runtime.exec or ProcessBuilder with user input.

      The following constructs are detected:
        - Runtime.getRuntime().exec
        - ProcessBuilder.start

      Ensure to properly validate and sanitize the inputs.
```

### Explanation:
1. **Patterns:**
   - The `$PROC = Runtime.getRuntime().exec($CMD)` pattern captures cases where the `exec` method of the Runtime class is used with a single command string.
   - Other `exec` usage patterns with arguments are captured using variations like `$PROC = Runtime.getRuntime().exec($CMD, ...)`.
   - The `ProcessBuilder` patterns capture the usage of `ProcessBuilder` to start a new process with single or multiple commands.
   
2. **Metavariable Regex:**
   - The `metavariable-regex` is used to match potentially dangerous constructs within the commands (like `|`, `&`, etc.) which can indicate possible injection points.
   
3. **Message:** 
   - The `message` provides details on what has been detected and advises validation and sanitization of inputs to avoid this type of vulnerability.

This rule is designed to catch patterns common in Java code where command injection might occur. Usage of `Runtime.exec` and `ProcessBuilder.start` with potentially untrusted user input is flagged.

Feel free to adapt this rule further for specific variations or additional frameworks if needed.
