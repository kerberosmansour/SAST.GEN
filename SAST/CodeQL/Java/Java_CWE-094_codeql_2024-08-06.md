ToTo generate a CodeQL SAST rule for detecting "Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')" (CWE-094) in Java, follow the steps below. 

### Context Review

Firstly, it's important to understand the structure and best practices for writing CodeQL rules.

1. **Structure of `.ql` Files**: CodeQL queries are written with a `.ql` extension and contain a `select` clause. They typically include sections for metadata, imports, the definition of classes or predicates, from clauses for declaring variables, where clauses for logical conditions, and select statements to define the results【4:2†source】【4:6†source】.

2. **Using Metadata**: Metadata in CodeQL queries helps in understanding the query's purpose, categorizing the type of issues it detects, and providing references【4:18†source】【4:19†source】.

3. **QL Constructs**: Common constructs include `from-where-select` expressions, predicate definitions, class definitions and usage of libraries. Advanced features like data flow analysis, control flow analysis, and taint tracking are crucial for precise vulnerability detection.

4. **Style Guide**: The CodeQL style guide suggests best practices such as one conjunct per line, proper parenthesizing of `if-then-else` constructs, and consistency in qualifying calls to predicates【4:13†source】【4:14†source】.

### Vulnerability Analysis

**Improper Control of Generation of Code in Java** typically manifests in dynamic code execution scenarios where user-supplied input can be executed. This can happen via reflection, scripting engines, or other means which interpret and execute code constructed from inputs.

**Common coding practices and patterns** which may lead to this vulnerability include:
1. Using `Runtime.exec` or `ProcessBuilder` with untrusted input.
2. Using reflection methods such as `Class.forName`, `Method.invoke`, or `Field.set`, etc., with user-controlled input.
3. Scripting with `ScriptEngine` in Java.

### CodeQL Rule Creation

Below is a set of CodeQL rules designed to detect this vulnerability. The rules use data flow and taint tracking to trace potentially unsafe code paths that involve dynamic code execution.

#### Rule for Detecting Unsafe Reflection Usage

```ql
/**
 * @name Unsafe Reflection Usage
 * @description Detects instances where reflection is used with untrusted input
 * @kind problem
 * @problem.severity error
 * @precision high
 * @id java/reflection-injection
 * @tags security
 */
import java
import semmle.code.java.dataflow.DataFlow
import semmle.code.java.dataflow.TaintTracking
import semmle.code.dataflow.TaintTracking

class ReflectionSource extends TaintTracking::Source {
  ReflectionSource() { this = MethodAccess }
  
  override predicate isSource(DataFlow::Node node) {
    exists(MethodAccess ma | ma.getAnArgument() = node.asExpr())
  }
}

class ReflectionSink extends TaintTracking::Sink {
  ReflectionSink() { this = Method.invoke(_) }
  
  override predicate isSink(DataFlow::Node node) {
    node.asExpr() instanceof MethodInvocation
  }
}

from TaintedPath tp, MethodAccess ma
where
  tp.hasFlowPath(ReflectionSource(), ReflectionSink())
select ma, "Potentially unsafe reflection with untrusted input."
```

#### Rule for Detecting Usage of `Runtime.exec` or `ProcessBuilder`

```ql
/**
 * @name Command Injection
 * @description Detects instances where Runtime.exec or ProcessBuilder is used with untrusted input
 * @kind problem
 * @problem.severity error
 * @precision high
 * @id java/command-injection
 * @tags security
 */
import java
import semmle.code.java.dataflow.DataFlow
import semmle.code.java.dataflow.TaintTracking
import semmle.code.dataflow.TaintTracking

class ExecSource extends TaintTracking::Source {
  ExecSource() { this = MethodAccess }
  
  override predicate isSource(DataFlow::Node node) {
    exists(MethodAccess ma | ma.getAnArgument() = node.asExpr())
  }
}

class ExecSink extends TaintTracking::Sink {
  ExecSink() { this = MethodAccess and
      this.getMethod().getName() = "exec" or
      this.getMethod().getName() = "start" }
  
  override predicate isSink(DataFlow::Node node) {
    node.asExpr() instanceof MethodInvocation
  }
}

from TaintedPath tp, MethodAccess ma
where
  tp.hasFlowPath(ExecSource, ExecSink)
select ma, "Potentially unsafe usage of Runtime.exec() or ProcessBuilder.start() with untrusted input."
```

### Testing and Validation

**Test Cases**: Provide a mix of positive and negative test cases:

1. **Typical Use Cases**: Use simple examples where user input is directly passed to reflection methods, `Runtime.exec`, or `ProcessBuilder`.
2. **Edge Cases**: Include cases where the input passes through several layers of method calls or transformations before being used unsafely.
3. **False Positives/Negatives**: Ensure there are cases where the input sanitizes or escapes properly to confirm the absence of false positives.

**Validation**:
1. **Using the CodeQL Query Console**: Use the CodeQL Query Console to run these rules on known codebases that include examples of these vulnerabilities.
2. **GitHub Code Scanning**: Run the queries in GitHub Code Scanning workflows on repositories to verify their effectiveness.

Following these steps will help in creating precise and reliable CodeQL rules for detecting improper control of generation of code ('Code Injection') vulnerabilities in Java.
