###### Creation of CodeQL Rules for Integer Overflow or Wraparound (CWE-190) in Java

#### 1. Context Review

**Guidelines and Best Practices for Writing CodeQL Rules:**

When writing CodeQL rules, it is essential to follow the recommended guidelines and best practices to ensure the effectiveness and accuracy of the rules. Here are general guidelines and best practices extracted from the documents:

- **Metadata setup:** Ensure to use appropriate metadata fields such as `@name`, `@id`, `@kind`, `@problem.severity`, `@tags`, etc.
- **QL Constructs:** Familiarize yourself with QL constructs such as predicates, classes, and their methods and fields.
- **Line Breaks and Indentation:** Adhere to proper indentation and line break conventions for better readability. Use 2 spaces for indentation.
- **Predicate definitions:** Define predicates with meaningful names and document them appropriately.
- **Data Flow and Taint Tracking:** Use data flow and taint tracking libraries extensively to enhance the accuracy of the rules.
- **Creating clear conditions for detections:** Focus on minimizing false positives by well-defining the conditions under which a potential vulnerability is flagged.
- **Modular Query Structure:** Structure queries in a modular fashion for reusability and maintainability   .

#### 2. Vulnerability Analysis

**Integer Overflow or Wraparound (CWE-190) in Java:**

Integer overflow happens when an arithmetic operation attempts to create a numeric value that is outside of the range that can be represented by the underlying integer type. In Java, this often manifests in the following ways:
- Operations resulting in a value larger than `Integer.MAX_VALUE` or smaller than `Integer.MIN_VALUE`.
- Use of standard arithmetic operators like `+`, `-`, `*`, `/` without proper range checks.

**Common patterns leading to Integer Overflow:**
1. **Addition operations:**
    ```java
    int sum = a + b;
    ```
2. **Multiplication operations:**
    ```java
    int product = a * b;
    ```
3. **Accumulative Loops:**
    ```java
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        total += values[i];
    }
    ```
4. **Implicit Casting to Larger Types:**
    Using small data types (e.g., `short`, `byte`) can lead to overflows when casting to larger types.

#### 3. CodeQL Rule Creation

**CodeQL Rules to Detect Integer Overflow or Wraparound in Java**

```ql
/**
 * @name Potential integer overflow in addition
 * @description Identifies cases where integer overflow could occur in addition
 * @kind path-problem
 * @id cwe190.addition.overflow
 * @problem.severity error
 * @precision high
 * @tags security
 *       external/cwe/cwe-190
 */
// Import relevant CodeQL libraries.
import java
import semmle.code.java.dataflow.FlowSources
import semmle.code.java.dataflow.TaintTracking

class InsecureAddition extends TaintTracking::FunctionCallFlowSource {
  InsecureAddition() { this.getACall().getMethodName() = "+" }
}

from Expr additionExpr, InsecureAddition additionSource
where
  additionExpr = additionSource.getSource() 
  and additionExpr.getType().hasQualifiedName("java.lang.Integer")
select additionExpr, "Potential integer overflow in addition."
```

```ql
/**
 * @name Potential integer overflow in multiplication
 * @description Identifies cases where integer overflow could occur in multiplication
 * @kind problem
 * @id cwe190.multiplication.overflow
 * @problem.severity error
 * @precision high
 * @tags security
 *       external/cwe/cwe-190
 */
// Import relevant CodeQL libraries.
import java
import semmle.code.java.dataflow.FlowSources
import semmle.code.java.dataflow.TaintTracking

class InsecureMultiplication extends TaintTracking::FunctionCallFlowSource {
  InsecureMultiplication() { this.getACall().getMethodName() = "*" }
}

from Expr mulExpr, InsecureMultiplication mulSource
where
  mulExpr = mulSource.getSource()
  and mulExpr.getType().hasQualifiedName("java.lang.Integer")
select mulExpr, "Potential integer overflow in multiplication."
```

#### 4. Testing and Validation of CodeQL Rules

**Test Cases:**

```java
public class TestIntegerOverflow {

  public void testAdditionOverflow() {
    int a = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
    int b = 1;
    int result = a + b;  // Potential overflow
  }

  public void testMultiplicationOverflow() {
    int a = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
    int b = 2;
    int result = a * b;  // Potential overflow
  }

  public void testAccumulativeLoop() {
    int sum = 0;
    int[] values = { Integer.MAX_VALUE, 2, 3 };
    for (int value : values) {
      sum += value;  // Potential overflow
    }
  }
}
```

**Validation:**
- **Unit Tests:** Write unit tests that cover various scenarios, including typical use cases and edge cases.
- **CodeQL Query Console:** Use the CodeQL query console to run these queries against large codebases to validate and refine them.
- **GitHub Code Scanning:** Integrate the queries into GitHub Code Scanning to analyze multiple repositories and gather insights.

**Guidelines for Tests and Validation:**
- Incrementally refine rules based on test results to minimize false positives and negatives.
- Use taint tracking and data flow analysis to enhance the precision of catching vulnerabilities.

By following these detailed and structured steps, you can create effective CodeQL rules for detecting integer overflow or wraparound vulnerabilities in Java applications   .
