###### Context Review for Writing CodeQL Rules

To create effective CodeQL rules, especially for detecting SQL Injection vulnerabilities in C# (CWE-089), we need to focus on several critical aspects:

1. **Structure of `.ql` Files**:
    - `predicate` definition: They define logical conditions that restrict which values fulfill the criteria.
    - `select` statement: Chooses the results or alerts produced from the predicates.
  
2. **Metadata Usage**:
    - Include fields like `@name`, `@description`, `@kind`, `@problem.severity`, and `@precision`  .
    - Security-related rules should also have CWE tags.

3. **QL Constructs**:
    - Use QL’s abilities to perform **data flow analysis**, **control flow analysis**, and **taint tracking** to effectively locate potential vulnerabilities【4:0†source】 .
    - Aim for predicates that handle typical cases effectively while exploring potential edge cases to minimize **false negatives** and **false positives**【4:0†source】 .

### Identifying Vulnerability Patterns for SQL Injection in C#

SQL Injection vulnerabilities in C# typically manifest in scenarios where user input is concatenated directly into SQL queries without proper sanitization. Here are common patterns:

1. **Direct String Concatenation**:
    ```csharp
    string query = "SELECT * FROM Users WHERE Username = '" + userInput + "'";
    ```

2. **Usage with `SqlCommand` without Parameters**:
    ```csharp
    SqlCommand cmd = new SqlCommand("SELECT * FROM Users WHERE Username = '" + userInput + "'", connection);
    ```

3. **ORM Usage**:
    - **Entity Framework (EF)**:
        Direct LINQ queries using unchecked user input can also be vulnerable:
        ```csharp
        var user = context.Users.Where(u => u.Username == userInput).FirstOrDefault();
        ```

### Creating CodeQL Rules for SQL Injection

The following QL script can be designed to detect these typical SQL Injection patterns in C#:

```ql
// Define path context, recognizing user inputs from parameter nodes to possible SQL command by taint tracking
import csharp
import semmle.code.csharp.dataflow.DataFlow
import semmle.code.csharp.dataflow.TaintTracking

class SqlInjectionConfig extends TaintTracking::Configuration {
  SqlInjectionConfig() { this = "SQL Injection Configuration" }

  override predicate isSource(Node source) {
    // User inputs, e.g., from ASP.NET request parameters
    source instanceof ParameterNode and
    source.getType().(Type).getName() = "string"
  }

  override predicate isSink(Node sink) {
    exists(SqlCommand sc |
      // Looking for direct use in SqlCommand text construction
      sc.getAnArgument() = sink
    ) or
    // ORMs like EntityFramework
    exists(LambdaExpr lambda |
      sink = lambda.getABody().getAnArgument()
    )
  }
}

from Method method, DataFlow::Node src, DataFlow::Node sink
where
  SqlInjectionConfig().hasFlow(src, sink) and
  method = src.getEnclosingCallable()
select method, src, sink, "Possible SQL Injection vulnerability involving user input without sanitization."
```

### Testing and Validation

1. **Unit Test Cases**:
    Prepare test samples for SQL Injection vulnerabilities, including:
    - Direct SQL command concatenations.
    - Uses of `SqlCommand` and ORMs without parameterization.

2. **Usage of the CodeQL Console**:
    - Test the queries within the CodeQL query console.
    - Run the CodeQL analysis over repositories that use a mix of raw SQL commands and ORMs to ensure comprehensive coverage.

3. **Further Refinement and Tuning**:
    - Examine potential false positives from the test runs.
    - Optimize query performance by avoiding complex recursive predicates and using efficient joins   .

By correctly leveraging CodeQL’s advanced capabilities and conducting thorough testing, these rules will help reliably detect SQL Injection vulnerabilities in C# applications.
