###### Review of Guidelines and Best Practices
To create effective CodeQL rules, refer to guidelines and best practices on writing queries, structuring `.ql` files, and using QL constructs. The CodeQL documentation emphasizes several key approaches:

1. **Helper Predicates**: Creating reusable logic, like identifying string concatenation used in query arguments.
2. **Data Flow and Taint Tracking**: leveraging libraries for comprehensive security queries.
3. **Inter-Procedural Analysis**: Defining sources and sinks to restrict analysis to relevant paths and ensure tractability.
4. **Sanitization and Barriers**: Identifying and handling sanitizers to break taint flow.

### Vulnerability Analysis: Improper Neutralization in C#
`Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in an Expression Language Statement (Expression Language Injection) (CWE-917)` occurs when application constructs an expression using user inputs without proper validation or escaping. In C#, popular libraries and frameworks like ASP.NET, Razor, or any custom templating engines could be vulnerable when mishandling user inputs in expressions.

#### Key Scenarios to Investigate:
1. **String Concatenation in Expressions**:
String concatenation involving user inputs directly used in expressions is a classic vulnerability pattern.
   
2. **Dynamic Method Invocations**:
Using `reflection` or dynamic method invocations with user input could lead to expression injection if these aren’t sanitized properly.

3. **Template Engines (e.g., Razor)**:
Code rendering dynamic pages using template engines without input sanitization.

### Creating the CodeQL Rule

#### Step 1: Define the Source
Focus on identifying potential sources of untrusted data. Common sources in C# include:
- Unvalidated request parameters (`HttpRequest`), form inputs, or query strings.

#### Step 2: Define the Sinks
Identify where these sources are used unsafely in expressions:
- Usage in dynamic expressions, Razor views, or string concatenations within parsing contexts.

#### Example CodeQL Query to Detect CWE-917:

```ql
import csharp
import semmle.code.csharp.security.dataflow.TaintTracking

class Config extends TaintTracking::Configuration {

  Config() {this = "ExpressionLanguageInjectionConfig"}

  override predicate isSource(TaintTracking::Node source) {
    exists(HttpRequest req |
      source.asExpr() = req.getParameter(_)
    )
  }

  override predicate isSink(TaintTracking::Node sink) {
    exists (Expr e |
      e.asExpr() = sink.asExpr() and
      e.getParent() instanceof AddExpr // Checking string concatenation context
    )
  }

  override predicate isSanitizer(TaintTracking::Node sanitizer) {
    exists(Expr e |
      // Define common sanitization methods
      e.asExpr() = sanitizer.asExpr() and
      e.getMethod().getName() = "HtmlEncode"  // Add more sanitization methods if needed
    )
  }
}

from Config c, TaintTracking::PathNode source, TaintTracking::PathNode sink
where c.hasFlowPath(source, sink)
select sink, "Potential Expression Language Injection from " + source.asLocation().toString()
```

### Explanation:
1. **Source**: Identifies user inputs coming from `HttpRequest` parameters.
2. **Sink**: Checks for sinks where expressions use concatenations unsafely.
3. **Sanitizer**: Includes common sanitization methods that interrupt the taint flow like `HtmlEncode`.

### Testing and Validation

#### Creating Test Cases:
1. Positive Test Case: Code with untrusted inputs being used directly in expressions.
2. Negative Test Case: Code properly sanitizing inputs.
3. Edge Cases: Less common patterns e.g., indirect input concatenations, use of multiple dynamic constructs requiring deeper data flow tracking.

To validate the rules:
- Run them in the CodeQL query console against test repositories that simulate real-world applications.
- Leverage GitHub Code Scanning to apply these rules to multiple large codebases, observing the rules' efficiency and tuning thresholds for false positives/negatives.

Through detailed auditing and refinement, these CodeQL rules will provide robust detection for CWE-917 vulnerabilities while minimizing false positives and negatives【4:0†source】.
