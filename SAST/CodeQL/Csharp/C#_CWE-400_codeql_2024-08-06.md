###### Task: Generate CodeQL SAST Rules for Uncontrolled Resource Consumption (CWE-400) in C#

#### Step 1: Context Review
Based on the information gathered, the structure of a CodeQL rule typically includes:
- **Module Declarations:** Define the scope and configuration of the query.
- **Predicate Declarations:** Establish specific conditions that identify the vulnerability.
- **Data Flow Tracking:** Identify the flow of data through the codebase using sources and sinks.
- **Control Flow Analysis:** Examine the flow of control through methods to ensure that no unhandled paths exist.
- **Query Annotations:** Use metadata to describe the query, including its ID, tags, and severity.

Below are some key terminology and practices:
- **Annotations:** Used for modifying declarations, such as `@meta`.
- **Binary Operators:** Logical connectors such as `and`, `or`, `implies`.
- **Quantifiers:** Logical qualifiers like `exists`, `forall` used to make the code concise and powerful.

#### Step 2: Vulnerability Analysis: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption (CWE-400) in C#

This vulnerability arises from the excessive use of system resources, potentially leading to denial of service (DoS). Some common scenarios include:
- Excessive memory allocation or memory leaks.
- Uncontrolled threads or process creation.
- Unbounded loops and recursive functions without a base condition.

#### Step 3: CodeQL Rule Creation

**Example 1: Detecting Excessive Memory Allocation**
```ql
import csharp

class ExcessiveMemoryAllocation extends DataFlow::Configuration {
  ExcessiveMemoryAllocation() { this = "ExcessiveMemoryAllocation" }
  
  override predicate isSource(DataFlow::Node source) {
    source.asExpr() instanceof AllocationExpr
  }
  
  override predicate isSink(DataFlow::Node sink) {
    exists(MethodAccess ma | ma.getMethod().hasName("Store") | sink.asExpr() = ma.getArgument(0))
  }
}

from DataFlow::Node src, DataFlow::Node sink
where ExcessiveMemoryAllocation().flow(src, sink)
select src, "This memory allocation might lead to excessive resource consumption.", sink, "Allocated memory is stored here."
```

**Example 2: Detecting Unbounded Loops**
```ql
import csharp

predicate excessiveLoopCondition(Statement loop) {
  loop instanceof ForStmt and not exists(loop as ForStmt).getCondition().(ComparisonExpr).getOperator() = "<="
  or
  loop instanceof WhileStmt and not exists(loop as WhileStmt).getCondition().(ComparisonExpr).getOperator() = "<="
}

from Statement loop
where excessiveLoopCondition(loop)
select loop, "This loop may be unbounded, causing excessive CPU usage."
```

**Example 3: Detecting Uncontrolled Thread Creation**
```ql
import csharp

predicate uncontrolledThread(Method m) {
  exists(Call c | c.getTarget().hasName("Start") and
                c.getQualifier().getType() instanceof ThreadType and 
                m.getAControlFlowNode() = c)
  and not exists {
    Expr e | e = c.getAnArgument() |
    e.getType() instanceof BoolType and
    e.toString() = "false"
  }
}

from Method m
where uncontrolledThread(m)
select m, "This method starts a thread without controlling its execution, potentially leading to resource exhaustion."
```

#### Step 4: Testing and Validation

**Test Cases:**
1. **Memory Allocation:**
   ```csharp
   public void AllocateMemory() {
       int[] largeArray = new int[1000000000]; // Potential excessive allocation
       Store(largeArray);
   }
   ```

2. **Unbounded Loop:**
   ```csharp
   public void InfiniteLoop() {
     while(true) { // Unbounded
       // do something
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Uncontrolled Thread Creation:**
   ```csharp
   public void StartThread() {
     Thread t = new Thread(new ThreadStart(LongRunningProcess));
     t.Start(); // Uncontrolled
   }
   ```

**Guidelines for Testing:**
- **CodeQL Query Console:** Use the CodeQL Query Console to run the above queries against target codebases.
- **GitHub Code Scanning:** Integrate these queries into GitHub Code Scanning to automate detection in CI/CD pipelines.
- **Variations and Frameworks:** Test these rules against variations and across different frameworks (ASP.NET, EF Core) to ensure broad applicability.

By structuring and testing the rules as demonstrated, developers and security teams can effectively detect and mitigate CWE-400 vulnerabilities in C# applications.
