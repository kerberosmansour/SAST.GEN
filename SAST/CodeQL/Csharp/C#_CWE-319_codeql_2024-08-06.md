###### Step 1: Context Review

#### CodeQL Rule Structure

CodeQL rules are generally structured in the `.ql` files using predicates, classes, and methods to define conditions and identify patterns that indicate security issues. Here are some key aspects:

1. **Metadata Annotations**: Provides information such as ID, severity, and description.
2. **Query**: Defines the logical conditions for identifying the issue.
3. **Configuration Options**: Allows flexibility in how the rule is applied.

### Step 2: Vulnerability Analysis for CWE-319 in C#

#### CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information

CWE-319 refers to the transmission of sensitive information in cleartext. In C#, this vulnerability can manifest through various coding practices and patterns, such as:

1. **Use of HTTP Instead of HTTPS**:
   ```csharp
   HttpClient client = new HttpClient();
   HttpResponseMessage response = await client.GetAsync("http://example.com");
   ```
2. **Cleartext Credentials in Web API Requests**:
   ```csharp
   var credentials = "username:password";
   var base64Credentials = Convert.ToBase64String(Encoding.ASCII.GetBytes(credentials));
   ```
3. **Cleartext Information in Sockets**:
   ```csharp
   TcpClient client = new TcpClient("example.com", 80);
   Stream stream = client.GetStream();
   StreamWriter writer = new StreamWriter(stream);
   writer.WriteLine("Sensitive Information");
   writer.Flush();
   ```

#### Frameworks and Libraries

1. **HttpClient**: Frequently used for making web requests.
2. **TcpClient**: Used for socket programming.
3. **WebRequest/WebResponse**: Older methods for making HTTP requests.

### Step 3: CodeQL Rule Creation

Here's a basic example and detailed breakdown for creating CodeQL rules to detect cleartext transmission in C#. Subsequent examples will build upon this to consider various patterns and edge cases.

#### Basic Example:

```ql
/*
 * This query identifies HTTP requests made using HttpClient in cleartext.
 */

import csharp

class CleartextHttpClientRequest extends CallExpr {
  CleartextHttpClientRequest() {
    exists(CallExpr call |
        call.getTarget().getName() = "GetAsync" and
        call.getTarget().getDeclaringType().getName() = "HttpClient" and
        call.getAnArgument().toString().matches("http://%")
    )
  }
}

from CleartextHttpClientRequest request
select request, "This HTTP request transmits data in cleartext."
```

#### Advanced Example with Data Flow Analysis:

```ql
import csharp
import DataFlow::PathGraph

class CleartextHttpClientRequestConfig extends TaintTracking::Configuration {
  CleartextHttpClientRequestConfig() { this = "CleartextHttpClientRequestConfig" }

  override predicate isSource(Node source) {
    exists(CallExpr sourceCall |
      sourceCall.getTarget().getName() = "GetAsync" and
      sourceCall.getTarget().getDeclaringType().getName() = "HttpClient" and
      sourceCall.getAnArgument().toString().matches("http://%")
    )
  }

  override predicate isSink(Node sink) {
    sink = DataFlow::globalLatencyStep(sink, _) and 
    sink.asExpr().getType().getPrimitiveType().hasName("SensitiveInformation")
  }
}

from CleartextHttpClientRequestConfig cfg, Node source, Node sink
where cfg.hasFlow(source, sink)
select sink, "Sensitive information is transmitted in cleartext by using HTTP."
```

#### Edge Cases:

1. **Using `WebRequest` Instead of `HttpClient`**:
```ql
import csharp

class InsecureWebRequest extends Expr {
  InsecureWebRequest() {
    exists(Variable v |
      v.hasName("request") and 
      v.getType().getName() = "WebRequest" and 
      v.getAnAccess().getDeclaringType().getAnAccess().matches("http://%"))
  }
}

from InsecureWebRequest request
select request, "This WebRequest transmits data in cleartext."
```

### Step 4: Testing and Validation

#### Test Cases:

1. **Typical Use Cases**:
   - Making an HTTP request using `HttpClient`.
   - Sending data over a non-encrypted socket using `TcpClient`.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - Using different libraries like `WebRequest`.
   - Hardcoded URLs with HTTP scheme.

#### Testing Methods:

1. **CodeQL Query Console**:
   - Use the query console to run the defined queries against a variety of C# codebases to ensure they work as intended.
 
2. **GitHub Code Scanning**:
   - Set up GitHub Code Scanning with CodeQL to continuously monitor and test your repos for the defined vulnerabilities.

### Conclusion

The CodeQL rules for detecting CWE-319 in C# should be structured around identifying unencrypted HTTP requests and other cleartext transmissions using common libraries such as `HttpClient` and `TcpClient`. Advanced methods involving data flow and taint tracking should be used to minimize false positives and negatives. To ensure the accuracy and effectiveness of the rules, comprehensive test cases and validation methods should be employed. The guidelines and best practices for writing CodeQL rules will ensure the robustness and reliability of the created rules   .
