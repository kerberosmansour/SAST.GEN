###### Creating CodeQL SAST Rules for Path Traversal (CWE-022) in C#

#### 1. **Context Review**: Understanding the Structure and Guidelines for CodeQL Queries
To create effective CodeQL rules, it’s crucial to understand the query structure, metadata usage, and syntax for path and alert queries:

- **Query Structure**: A query file in CodeQL generally starts with metadata, followed by imports, optional class/predicate definitions, variable declarations in the `from` clause, conditions in the `where` clause, and the results in the `select` clause【4:0†source】.
- **Data Flow Analysis**: This is a significant feature in CodeQL which helps track data from sources to sinks. Utilizing predicates like `isSource()` and `isSink()` helps define where data can flow from and to【4:2†source】.
- **Path Queries**: Enable visualization of data flow from sources to sinks. It is beneficial for identifying vulnerabilities linked with data propagation through an application【4:2†source】【4:9†source】【4:2†source】.
- **Defining Outputs**: The results of a query are defined using the `select` statement, which includes the elements, sources, sinks, and descriptive alert messages.【4:13†source】【4:17†source】.

#### 2. **Vulnerability Analysis**: Understanding Path Traversal in C#
Path Traversal vulnerabilities in C# often occur due to improper validation of user input when forming file system paths. Here are some common patterns:

- **Static Path Concatenation**:
    ```csharp
    string fullPath = "/var/www/html/" + userInput;
    ```
- **Path Manipulation**:
    ```csharp
    string root = "/var/www/html/";
    string fullPath = Path.Combine(root, userInput);
    ```

#### 3. **CodeQL Rule Creation**: Detecting Path Traversal Vulnerabilities
To accurately detect these issues, let’s make use of CodeQL's data flow analysis and path query features to define precise Source and Sink match patterns:

```ql
/**
 * @name Path Traversal in C#
 * @description Identifies possible Path Traversal vulnerabilities
 * in C# applications by tracking user-controlled input to file system operations.
 * @kind path-problem
 * @severity error
 * @id cs/path-traversal
 * @tags security
 *       external/cwe/cwe-022
 */

import csharp
import semmle.code.csharp.dataflow.FlowSources
import semmle.code.csharp.dataflow.PathGraph

class UserInput extends TaintSource {
  UserInput() { this.hasLocationInfo() }
  override predicate isSource(DataFlow::Node source) {
    source.asExpr() instanceof ParameterAccess
  }
}

class FileSystemSink extends TaintSink {
  FileSystemSink() { this.hasLocationInfo() }
  override predicate isSink(DataFlow::Node sink) {
    sink.asExpr() instanceof MethodCallExpr and
    sink.asExpr().getMethod().getName() = "Combine"
  }
}

from PathNode source, PathNode sink, string message
where
  // Configuring data flow from user input to file operations.
  TaintTracking::trackTaint(
    new UserInput(),
    new FileSystemSink(),
    source, sink, message
  )
select sink, source, sink, "Possible Path Traversal vulnerability: user input from " + source + " reaches file operation " + sink + ". " + message
```

#### 4. **Testing and Validation**: Effective Validation and Coverage
To ensure minimal false positives and negatives, thorough testing with multiple test cases is essential. Here’s how to set it up and what to validate:

1. **Test Case Setup**: Create various scenarios, including edge cases, to validate the CodeQL rules. Example C# test cases can include:
    - Simple concatenation of user input with a static path.
    - User input passed to `Path.Combine()`.
    - Nested and indirect user input assignments affecting file path creation.

2. **Testing Methods**:
    - **Local Testing**: Use the CodeQL Query Console in Visual Studio Code.
    - **CI Integration**: Run the query using GitHub Actions or other CI tools that integrate with CodeQL for continuous analysis across codebases.
  
3. **Sample Test Case**:
    ```csharp
    // This should trigger an alert
    using System;
    using System.IO;

    public class PathTraversalTest {
        public void VulnerableMethod(string userInput) {
            string fullPath = "/var/data/" + userInput;
            File.ReadAllBytes(fullPath);
        }

        public void SafeMethod(string userInput) {
            // This should not trigger an alert
            string sanitizedInput = Path.GetFileName(userInput);
            string fullPath = Path.Combine("/var/data/", sanitizedInput);
            File.ReadAllBytes(fullPath);
        }
    }
    ```

These steps ensure the created CodeQL rule is accurate and effective in identifying potential Path Traversal vulnerabilities in C# applications with minimal false positives and negatives.
