###### Task: Generate CodeQL SAST Rules for Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection') (CWE-094) in C#

#### 1. Context Review:

From the CodeQL guidelines and best practices, we need to focus on:
- **Structure of `.ql` files**: Typically includes import statements, metadata, and the query definition itself.
- **Use of metadata**: Is essential for query categorization and descriptions.
- **Advanced QL Constructs**:
  - **Data flow analysis**: To track how data moves through the program.
  - **Control flow analysis**: To track how control structures impact the program.
  - **Taint tracking**: Useful in identifying potentially malicious inputs being used in sensitive operations.

#### 2. Vulnerability Analysis:

Code injection vulnerabilities (CWE-094) in C# can occur when the code allows dynamic generation and execution of code based on user input. Common scenarios include:
- Use of methods like `Eval`, `Execute`, or constructing SQL queries using direct string interpolation/concatenation.
- Dynamic code execution via `CSharpCodeProvider` or similar classes.
- Reflection-based code execution or method invocation relying on external input.

#### 3. CodeQL Rule Creation:

For detecting improper handling of code generation and code injection in C#, we will create multiple predicates to cover various scenarios. 

Below is an example query for C#, demonstrating how to identify potential code injection vulnerabilities. This rule will focus on tracking tainted data flowing into methods prone to code injection.

```ql
/**
 * @name Code Injection Vulnerability (CWE-094)
 * @description Detects improper control of code generation or execution using user input in C# projects.
 * @kind path-problem
 * @problem.severity critical
 * @precision high
 */

 import csharp
 import semmle.code.csharp.controlflow.DataFlow
 import semmle.code.csharp.controlflow.internal.DataFlowImpl
 
 class TaintTrackingConfiguration extends TaintTracking::Configuration {
   TaintTracking::Source source() {
     // Define sources, e.g., user input
     any(Source::Input); // Example placeholder, replace with actual sources
   }
   
   override predicate isSource(DataFlow::Node source) {
     exists(Source s | s = source.asExpr().(Source))
   }
   
   override predicate isSink(DataFlow::Node sink) {
     exists(Call c |
       c.getTarget().getName() = "Eval" and
       sink = c.getAnArgument() or
       // Add other common sinks such as Execute, etc.
       c.getTarget().getName() = "Execute" and
       sink = c.getAnArgument()
     )
   }
 }
 
 from TaintTracking::Configuration cfg, DataFlow::PathNode source, DataFlow::PathNode sink
 where cfg.hasFlowPath(source, sink)
 select sink.getNode(), source, sink, "Potential code injection vulnerability: data from $@ flows into $@.", source, sink
```

#### Key Points:

- **Source Definition**: This should include common sources of user input, such as HTTP request parameters, query strings, etc. The `Source` class would have to be defined accordingly.
- **Sink Definition**: Sinks like `Eval` and `Execute` methods are high-risk areas for code injection.
- **Taint Tracking**: Leverage CodeQLâ€™s built-in taint-tracking capabilities to trace how tainted data reaches risky sinks. 

#### 4. Testing and Validation:

- **Test Cases**:
  - Typical cases where user input flows directly into `Eval` or `Execute`.
  - Edge cases like data passing through multiple functions or being concatenated with other strings.
- **Running Queries**: 
  - Use the CodeQL query console for initial validation.
  - Apply queries in CI/CD pipelines through GitHub Code Scanning to monitor real-time integrity across large codebases.

Indicate locations of sources for refining and testing queries:
```ql
// Example of Source definition
class Source extends Expr {
  Source() { this instanceof (ParameterRef, VariableAccess)}
}

// Example of Sink definition matching typical code injection points
class Sink extends Call {
  Sink() {
    this.getTarget().getName().matches("Eval|Execute") or
    this.getTarget().getUnqualifiedName().matches("Eval|Execute")
  }
}
```
