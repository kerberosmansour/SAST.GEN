###### Context Review

#### Structure of CodeQL Files

CodeQL queries (`.ql` files) are structured to define classes, predicates, and rules using metadata annotations. The general structure includes:

1. **Import Statements**: To include necessary libraries and modules.
   ```ql
   import csharp
   ```

2. **Predicates**: Define reusable logic or conditions.
   ```ql
   predicate isDangerousFileType(string fileType) {
     fileType = ".exe" or fileType = ".dll" or ...
   }
   ```

3. **Classes**: To encapsulate logic related to specific types of code constructs.
   ```ql
   class DangerousFileUpload extends Expr {
     DangerousFileUpload() { ... }
   }
   ```

4. **Query Definitions**: The actual rule logic.
   ```ql
   from DangerousFileUpload upload
   where ...
   select ...
   ```

5. **Metadata Annotations**: Provide additional information like rule severity, ID, description, etc.
   ```ql
   /**
    * @name Detect dangerous file uploads
    * @description Detects unrestricted uploads of files with dangerous types.
    * @kind problem
    * @id csharp/dangerous-file-upload
    * @severity error
    * @precision high
    */
   ```

#### Best Practices for Writing CodeQL Rules

- Reuse predicates and classes to minimize redundancy.
- Use metadata to accurately describe the rule.
- Ensure queries are optimized for performance.
- Aim for high precision and recall by refining the conditions.

#### QL Constructs for C#

CodeQL has specific constructs for C#:
- **CSharp::Expr**: Represents an expression.
- **CSharp::Method**: Represents a method.
- **Data flow constructs**: To track the flow of data through the code.
- **Taint tracking constructs**: To identify tainted data sources.

### Vulnerability Analysis: CWE-434

#### Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type (CWE-434)

##### Description
CWE-434 occurs when an application allows files to be uploaded without proper validation of the file type. This vulnerability can lead to the execution of malicious files, which can compromise the system.

##### Common Coding Patterns Leading to This Vulnerability

1. **Directly Saving the Uploaded File**:
   ```csharp
   public void UploadFile(HttpPostedFile file) {
       var filePath = Path.Combine(Server.MapPath("~/Uploads"), Path.GetFileName(file.FileName));
       file.SaveAs(filePath); // Unsanitized file save
   }
   ```

2. **File Type Validation Bypass**:
    - Using only file extensions for validation which can be easily spoofed.
    - Not validating file content.

3. **Popular Frameworks**:
    - ASP.NET, ASP.NET Core: Common practices involve handling file uploads via `HttpPostedFile`, `IFormFile`, etc.

### CodeQL Rule Creation

#### Query to Detect Unrestricted File Uploads in C#

```ql
import csharp
import semmle.code.csharp.security.dataflow.TaintTracking

class DangerousFileType extends TaintedObject {
  DangerousFileType() {
    this.hasType("System.String") and
    this.isAnnotatedCodeFragment() and
    this.getType().getTypeName().matches("%file%")
  }
}

class FileSaveMethod extends Method {
  FileSaveMethod() {
    this.hasName("SaveAs") and this.getDeclaringType().hasName("System.Web.HttpPostedFile")
  }
}

class UnsafeFileUpload extends Call {
  UnsafeFileUpload() {
    exists (MethodCall call | 
      call.getMethod() instanceof FileSaveMethod | 
      call.getReceiverType() instanceof DangerousFileType
    )
  }
  
  override string getTaintSourceCode() {
    this.getAnArgument().getValue().toString()
  }
}

from UnsafeFileUpload upload
where upload.getTaintSourceCode().matches("%dangerous%")
select upload, "Unrestricted upload of file with dangerous type detected."
```

#### Testing and Validation

1. **Test Cases**:
   - Create sample applications in C# that perform file uploads.
   - Include both safe and unsafe file upload scenarios.
   - Validate that the CodeQL query correctly identifies the unsafe scenarios.

2. **Validation in CodeQL Console**:
   - Use GitHub's CodeQL query console or a local CodeQL setup to test the rules on sample codebases.
   - Ensure to include edge cases, such as scenarios where additional sanitization functions are used before saving the file.

3. **GitHub Advanced Security**:
   - Implement the CodeQL rules in GitHub Advanced Security.
   - Run the security analysis on various repositories to ensure wide coverage and effective detection.
