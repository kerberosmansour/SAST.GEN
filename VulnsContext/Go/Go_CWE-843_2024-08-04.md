# Access of Resource Using Incompatible Type ('Type Confusion') (CWE-843) in Go

###### Access of Resource Using Incompatible Type ('Type Confusion')

**Definition:**
Access of Resource Using Incompatible Type, commonly known as 'Type Confusion', occurs when code accesses a resource (e.g., data, memory) using a type that is not compatible with the actual type of the resource. This can lead to unpredictable behavior, crashes, or security vulnerabilities.

**Description:**
In Go, type confusion can happen due to the language's type assertion, interface-to-concrete type assertions, reflection, or unsafe package usage. This is a significant concern because it can lead to data corruption, security vulnerabilities involving unauthorized data access, or even remote code execution.

Here's an overview:

1. **Type Assertions**: When a Go type assertion is performed, and the actual type isn't the expected one, it can trigger a runtime panic.
2. **Reflection**: Using the reflect package to access fields or methods without proper type checks can lead to type confusion.
3. **Unsafe Package**: Direct memory manipulation via the unsafe package can easily lead to type confusion if types are misinterpreted.

### Examples in Go and Popular Frameworks

**1. Basic Type Assertion:**
```go
func process(data interface{}) {
    str := data.(string)  // Panics if data isn't a string
    fmt.Println(str)
}
```

**2. Type Assertions with Check:**
```go
func process(data interface{}) {
    str, ok := data.(string)
    if !ok {
        // handle the type mismatch
        fmt.Println("Type assertion failed")
    } else {
        fmt.Println(str)
    }
}
```

**3. Reflection:**
Using reflection, particularly with `reflect.Value.Interface()`, can lead to type confusion if the types are not carefully managed.
```go
import (
    "reflect"
    "fmt"
)

func printFieldValue(i interface{}) {
    v := reflect.ValueOf(i).FieldByName("Name")
    if v.IsValid() && v.Kind() == reflect.String {
        fmt.Println(v.String())
    } else {
        fmt.Println("Not a string")
    }
}
```

**4. Unsafe Package:**
Using `unsafe.Pointer` to convert between types can lead to severe type confusion bugs.
```go
import (
    "unsafe"
    "fmt"
)

func main() {
    var i int = 42
    var f float64
    f = *(*float64)(unsafe.Pointer(&i))  // This is not safe and leads to type confusion
    fmt.Println(f)
}
```

### Type Confusion in Popular Go Frameworks

**Gin Framework:**
Gin's middleware can be a place where type confusion might occur if `context` values are not correctly handled.
```go
import (
    "github.com/gin-gonic/gin"
    "net/http"
)

func main() {
    r := gin.Default()
    r.GET("/someData", func(c *gin.Context) {
        value, exists := c.Get("someKey")
        if !exists {
            c.JSON(http.StatusBadRequest, gin.H{"error": "no value"})
            return
        }
        strValue := value.(string)  // Type assertion without check can panic if the type isn't string
        c.String(http.StatusOK, strValue)
    })
    r.Run()
}
```

**Beego Framework:**
Beego's context can similarly have type confusion vulnerabilities.
```go
import (
    "github.com/beego/beego/v2/server/web"
)

type MainController struct {
    web.Controller
}

func (c *MainController) Get() {
    u := c.GetSession("username")
    username := u.(string)  // Panics if session data isn't a string
    c.Data["Username"] = username
    c.TplName = "index.tpl"
}

func main() {
    web.Router("/", &MainController{})
    web.Run()
}
```

### SAST Rules Definition for Detection

To write effective Static Application Security Testing (SAST) rules to detect type confusion in Go with minimal false positives and negatives, follow these guidelines:

1. **Identify all type assertions**:
   - For any type assertion `"x.(T)"`, verify if `"x"` is guaranteed to be of type `"T"` or handle the case where the assertion fails.

2. **Analyze usage of the `reflect` package**:
   - Check for `reflect.Value.Interface()` calls and ensure the code validates the exact type expected.

3. **Detect use of the `unsafe` package**:
   - Look for conversions using `unsafe.Pointer` and verify if the actual memory being referenced matches the expected type.

4. **Framework-specific detection**:
   - For frameworks like Gin and Beego, verify how request context values or session values are accessed and ensure type checks are present.

5. **Custom Rules for Popular Patterns**:
   - Create custom rules for common patterns in popular frameworks where type confusion is more likely to occur, such as session handling, middleware chaining, etc.

**Examples of SAST Rules:**

- **Type Assertion without Check**:
  ```plaintext
  pattern: $x.($T)
  ```
  This rule matches any type assertion operation and can be extended to ensure that the code handles the assertion failure case.

- **Reflect Package Misuse**:
  ```plaintext
  pattern: reflect.ValueOf($x).Interface()
  ```

- **Unsafe Package Usage**:
  ```plaintext
  pattern: unsafe.Pointer($x)
  ```

### Conclusion

By understanding the specific contexts in which type confusion can occur in Go and leveraging the capabilities of modern SAST tools, it's possible to write detection rules that strike a balance between minimizing false positives and false negatives. This involves careful pattern matching and ensuring contextual checks around type assertions, reflection, and unsafe operations.
