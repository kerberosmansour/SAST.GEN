# Uncontrolled Search Path Element (CWE-427) in Go

###### Understanding Uncontrolled Search Path Element in Application Security

**Uncontrolled Search Path Element** vulnerabilities occur when an application dynamically constructs or alters search paths for executable files, libraries, or other resources without validating their values. This manipulation can lead to unauthorized directories being added to the search path, resulting in the execution of malicious files. For Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tools, identifying such vulnerabilities with high precision is essential to minimize false positives and false negatives.

### Variations of Uncontrolled Search Path Element in Go

To provide comprehensive detection rules for Uncontrolled Search Path Element vulnerabilities in Go, we must consider multiple points where the Go application might dynamically construct or alter executable paths. Below are different variations of this vulnerability in Go, including popular frameworks:

1. **Environment Variables Configuration**
   - Go applications might set executable search paths using environment variables. If these paths incorporate untrusted input, it can introduce vulnerabilities.
   ```go
   package main

   import (
       "os"
       "os/exec"
   )

   func main() {
       // Using an environment variable to set PATH
       os.Setenv("PATH", "/usr/local/bin:" + os.Getenv("UNTRUSTED_VAR"))
       cmd := exec.Command("myapp")
       cmd.Run()
   }
   ```

2. **Dynamic PATH Manipulation**
   - Directly modifying the `PATH` environment variable in the application based on user inputs or other dynamic sources.
   ```go
   package main

   import (
       "os"
       "os/exec"
   )

   func main() {
       untrustedPath := "/some/untrusted/path"
       // Dynamically altering the PATH
       os.Setenv("PATH", os.Getenv("PATH") + ":" + untrustedPath)
       cmd := exec.Command("somecommand")
       cmd.Run()
   }
   ```

3. **Using `exec.LookPath` with Unsanitized Input**
   - The `exec.LookPath` function in Go is used to find an executable in the directories named by the `PATH` environment variable.
   ```go
   package main

   import (
       "os/exec"
       "fmt"
   )

   func main() {
       input := "/some/untrusted/path/mycmd"
       path, err := exec.LookPath(input)
       if err != nil {
           fmt.Println("Command not found")
       } else {
           fmt.Println("Command found at ", path)
       }
   }
   ```

### SAST Rules for Detection

To write SAST rules to detect Uncontrolled Search Path Element vulnerabilities in Go effectively, consider the following approaches:

1. **Detect Environment Variable Manipulation:**
   - Identify instances where environmental variables like `PATH` are being set or modified using `os.Setenv`.
   - Check if the values being set come from untrusted sources like user inputs, configuration files, or external data.

2. **Track Dynamic Values Affecting Paths:**
   - Trace variables that may affect the `PATH` or other critical environment variables.
   - Ensure these values are sanitized and validated before being used.

3. **Identify Usage of `exec.LookPath` with Untrusted Input:**
   - Look for calls to `exec.LookPath` where the input parameter is dynamic and potentially untrusted.
   - Ensure these inputs are validated or sanitized.

### Implementing Detection with Example Patterns

Here’s an example SAST detection rule in pseudo-code for a Go SAST tool:

```yaml
rules:
  - id: environment-path-vulnerability
    pattern: os.Setenv("PATH", "$partial")
    condition: |
      check $partial for untrusted input sources
 
  - id: path-dynamic-manipulation
    pattern: os.Getenv("PATH") + ":$partial"
    condition: |
      check $partial for untrusted input sources

  - id: exec-lookpath-vulnerability
    pattern: exec.LookPath("$partial")
    condition: |
      check $partial for untrusted input sources

conditions:
  - untrusted_sources:
      kind: [
        input_from_user,
        configuration_file,
        external_data
      ]
```

### Conclusion

By examining different variations of Uncontrolled Search Path Element vulnerabilities in Go and implementing precise detection rules, the SAST tool can effectively minimize false positives and false negatives. The key is to ensure that environmental variables, dynamic path manipulation, and functions like `exec.LookPath` are scrutinized adequately for untrusted inputs.
