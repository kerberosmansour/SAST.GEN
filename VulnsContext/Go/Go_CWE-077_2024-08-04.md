# Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection') (CWE-077) in Go

#### Overview of Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')

### Definition
Command Injection is a security vulnerability that occurs when an application sends untrusted data to a system shell. This can happen when the application integrates external input into command line executions without proper input validation or neutralization, allowing the attacker to manipulate the command. As a result, this can lead to the execution of arbitrary commands on the hosting system leading to data theft, loss, or unauthorized control.

### Consequences
The potential consequences of command injection attacks range widely and can include:
- Unauthorized data access or modification
- Execution of arbitrary or malicious commands
- Full compromise of the system's hosting environment

### Variations
Command injection vulnerabilities can manifest in diverse ways based on the application context and how the command is constructed. Common variations include:
1. **Direct Command Injection**: Where input is concatenated directly into the command line.
2. **Argument Injection**: Specially crafted input as command-line arguments.
3. **File Path Manipulation**: Using unsanitized input in file paths for commands.
4. **Escalated Command Execution**: Exploiting commands that run with elevated privileges.

## Command Injection Examples in Go

Below are examples of how command injection vulnerabilities can occur in Go, focusing on different frameworks and scenarios.

### Example 1: Direct Command Execution via `os/exec`
**Vulnerable Code:**
```go
package main

import (
    "os/exec"
    "net/http"
)

func handler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    name := r.URL.Query().Get("name")
    out, err := exec.Command("sh", "-c", "echo Hello "+name).Output()
    if err != nil {
        http.Error(w, err.Error(), http.StatusInternalServerError)
        return
    }
    w.Write(out)
}

func main() {
    http.HandleFunc("/", handler)
    http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil)
}
```
**Explanation:**
The user input `name` is directly constructed into a shell command without sanitization. An attacker could exploit this by sending `?name=;rm -rf /` to execute malicious commands.

### Example 2: Argument Injection with `os/exec`
**Vulnerable Code:**
```go
package main

import (
    "os/exec"
    "net/http"
)

func handler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    filename := r.URL.Query().Get("file")
    cmd := exec.Command("cat", filename)
    out, err := cmd.Output()
    if err != nil {
        http.Error(w, err.Error(), http.StatusInternalServerError)
        return
    }
    w.Write(out)
}

func main() {
    http.HandleFunc("/", handler)
    http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil)
}
```
**Explanation:**
The `filename` parameter is used as a command argument without validation. This could allow an attacker to escalate arguments such as `?file=nonexistent;rm -rf /`.

### Example 3: Using a Configurable System Command
**Vulnerable Code:**
```go
package main

import (
    "os/exec"
    "net/http"
    "os"
)

func handler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    cmd := os.Getenv("CMD")
    arg := r.URL.Query().Get("arg")
    out, err := exec.Command(cmd, arg).Output()
    if err != nil {
        http.Error(w, err.Error(), http.StatusInternalServerError)
        return
    }
    w.Write(out)
}

func main() {
    os.Setenv("CMD", "echo")
    http.HandleFunc("/", handler)
    http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil)
}
```
**Explanation:**
The environment variable `CMD` combined with `arg` could lead to an injection if a different command is set by an attacker via environment manipulation combined with user-provided `arg`.

### Example 4: Command Execution in a Popular Framework (e.g., Gin Gonic)
**Vulnerable Code:**
```go
package main

import (
    "github.com/gin-gonic/gin"
    "os/exec"
)

func main() {
    router := gin.Default()
    
    router.GET("/ping", func(c *gin.Context) {
        ip := c.Query("ip")
        out, err := exec.Command("ping", "-c 4", ip).Output()
        if err != nil {
            c.String(http.StatusInternalServerError, err.Error())
            return
        }
        c.String(http.StatusOK, string(out))
    })

    router.Run(":8080")
}
```
**Explanation:**
In this Gin Gonic-based web server, the `ip` parameter controlled by the user is directly passed to the ping command, which could be exploited to run arbitrary commands.

## Writing SAST Rules for Detection

When writing SAST rules to detect command injection vulnerabilities in Go, it is essential to account for various contexts and patterns. Here are some guidelines:

1. **Identifying Command Execution Functions:**
   - Look for `os/exec` package functions such as `exec.Command`, `exec.CommandContext`.
   
2. **Detecting Usages of Unsanitized Inputs:**
   - Track the origin of input parameters from functions such as `http.Request.Query.Get` or framework-specific query functions like `c.Query` in Gin.
   
3. **Patterns of Concatenation or Direct Injection:**
   - Identify direct concatenation patterns or argument passing without validation.
   
4. **Framework-Specific Entry Points:**
   - In frameworks like Gin, identify handlers and the usage of parameters within command invocations.

5. **Avoid False Positives:**
   - Ensure that rules account for proper validation or sanitization libraries if they are used correctly.

By focusing on these patterns and originating sources of dynamic input, detection rules can significantly reduce both false positives and negatives, achieving robust coverage of command injection vulnerabilities.
