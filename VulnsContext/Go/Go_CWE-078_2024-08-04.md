# Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection') (CWE-078) in Go

#### Explanation of OS Command Injection (CWE-78)

### Definition
OS Command Injection, also known as Command Injection, occurs when an application incorporates user input while constructing and executing system commands. If the input is not properly sanitized, an attacker can inject arbitrary commands into the shell, which the application will then execute with the same privileges as the running application.

### Example
For instance, consider a web application that takes a filename as input and lists the contents of the file using the `ls` command:

```go
package main

import (
	"log"
	"os"
	"os/exec"
)

func listFileContents(filename string) {
	cmd := exec.Command("sh", "-c", "ls -l "+filename)
	output, err := cmd.CombinedOutput()
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
	log.Printf("Output: %s", output)
}
```

If the `filename` parameter is controlled by an attacker, they can manipulate it to execute arbitrary commands by injecting special characters (like `;`, `|`, `&&`, etc.) to chain different commands.

Example of malicious input:
```
filename = "; rm -rf /; #"
```

This would turn the command into:
```
ls -l ; rm -rf /; #
```
This results in listing files followed by deleting the root directory.

### Variations in Go and Popular Frameworks

1. **Basic OS Command Injection**
   ```go
   package main

   import (
   	"log"
   	"os/exec"
   )

   func executeCommand(userInput string) {
   	cmd := exec.Command("sh", "-c", userInput)
   	output, err := cmd.CombinedOutput()
   	if err != nil {
   		log.Fatal(err)
   	}
   	log.Printf("Output: %s", output)
   }
   ```

2. **Echoing User Input**
   ```go
   package main

   import (
   	"log"
   	"os/exec"
   )

   func echoUserInput(userInput string) {
   	cmd := exec.Command("sh", "-c", "echo "+userInput)
   	output, err := cmd.CombinedOutput()
   	if err != nil {
   		log.Fatal(err)
   	}
   	log.Printf("Output: %s", output)
   }
   ```

3. **Using Third-Party Libraries** (e.g., [Gin](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin) framework)
   ```go
   package main

   import (
   	"github.com/gin-gonic/gin"
   	"log"
   	"net/http"
   	"os/exec"
   )

   func main() {
   	r := gin.Default()
   	r.GET("/exec", func(c *gin.Context) {
   		userInput := c.Query("input")
   		cmd := exec.Command("sh", "-c", userInput)
   		output, err := cmd.CombinedOutput()
   		if err != nil {
   			log.Fatal(err)
   		}
   		c.String(http.StatusOK, string(output))
   	})
   	r.Run(":8080")
   }
   ```

4. **Combining with File Operations**
   ```go
   package main

   import (
   	"log"
   	"os/exec"
   )

   func deleteUserFile(username string) {
   	cmd := exec.Command("sh", "-c", "rm /home/"+username+"/file.txt")
   	output, err := cmd.CombinedOutput()
   	if err != nil {
   		log.Fatal(err)
   	}
   	log.Printf("Output: %s", output)
   }
   ```

5. **Command Injection through Unsafe Libraries Functions**
   ```go
   package main

   import (
   	"log"
   	"os"
   	"os/exec"
   )

   func main() {
   	userInput := os.Getenv("USER_INPUT")
   	cmd := exec.Command("sh", "-c", userInput)
   	output, err := cmd.CombinedOutput()
   	if err != nil {
   		log.Fatal(err)
   	}
   	log.Printf("Output: %s", output)
   }
   ```

### Writing SAST Rules

To write high-quality SAST rules for detecting OS Command Injection in Go, focus on the following points:

1. **Identify the Use of `exec.Command`**:
   - Look for instances where `os/exec` package's `Command` or `CommandContext` functions are used.

2. **Track User Input Sources**:
   - Identify sources of user input, such as HTTP parameters, environment variables, and third-party library functions.

3. **Command Construction Pattern**:
   - Detect patterns where user input is concatenated within command strings, especially using shell-specific metacharacters (`;`, `|`, `&&`) that change command behavior.
   - Example of unsafe patterns:
     ```go
     cmd := exec.Command("sh", "-c", userInput)
     cmd := exec.Command("sh", "-c", "ls " + filename)
     ```

4. **Mitigations and Sanitizations**:
   - Warn if no sanitization or escaping functions are used before executing the constructed command.
   - Example of invalid sanitization:
     ```go
     safeInput := strings.ReplaceAll(userInput, ";", "")
     cmd := exec.Command("sh", "-c", "echo " + safeInput)
     ```

By focusing on these points, SAST tools can significantly reduce false negatives by ensuring user inputs are properly sanitized and commands are not constructed in a vulnerable manner. False positives can be minimized by validating the context and ensuring that legitimate uses of command execution (e.g., static or fully controlled commands) are not flagged.
