# Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type (CWE-434) in Go

###### Understanding Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type

**Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type** is a critical security vulnerability that occurs when a web application does not properly validate or restrict the types of files that users can upload. This can lead to several potential security threats, including:

1. **Remote Code Execution:** An attacker could upload a malicious script (e.g., a PHP file) that gets executed on the server.
2. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** An attacker could upload a file containing malicious scripts that get run in a user's browser.
3. **Denial of Service (DoS):** Attackers could upload large files or specially crafted files (e.g., ZIP bombs, XML bombs) to exhaust server resources.
4. **Unauthorized File Access:** Attackers could upload files that overwrite existing files on the server or access sensitive data.
5. **Content Spoofing/Phishing:** Malicious files (e.g., images, PDFs) could be used to trick users into providing sensitive information.

### Key Mitigation Strategies

Mitigating this vulnerability involves validating both the content and type of files being uploaded:

1. **File Extension Validation:** Only allow specific file extensions and ensure the validation cannot be bypassed easily (e.g., by using double extensions or null bytes)    .
2. **MIME Type Validation:** Validate the MIME type of the uploaded file to ensure it matches the expected type  .
3. **File Signature Validation:** Check the actual file content (magic bytes) to verify the file type.
4. **File Size Validation:** Implement limits on file size to prevent DoS attacks .
5. **Filename Restrictions:** Avoid using user-controlled file names and sanitize filenames   .
6. **Storage Best Practices:** Store uploaded files outside the webroot and restrict direct access via URL.

### Implementing Detection Rules for Go Applications

For Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tools, detecting unrestricted file upload vulnerabilities requires looking for insecure patterns in the code across Go frameworks. Below are some variations along with examples in Go:

#### 1. Standard Go HTTP File Upload

**Insecure Pattern:**
```go
http.HandleFunc("/upload", func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    file, _, err := r.FormFile("file")
    if err != nil {
        http.Error(w, "Bad Request", http.StatusBadRequest)
        return
    }
    defer file.Close()
    
    f, err := os.Create("/uploads/" + filename)
    if err != nil {
        http.Error(w, "Internal Server Error", http.StatusInternalServerError)
        return
    }
    defer f.Close()
    
    io.Copy(f, file)
    fmt.Fprintln(w, "Upload successful")
})
```

**Detection Rule Criteria:**
- Look for `r.FormFile`
- Check if the filename is directly used without validation
- Check for absence of MIME type and extension checks

#### 2. Gin Web Framework

**Insecure Pattern:**
```go
r.POST("/upload", func(c *gin.Context) {
    file, err := c.FormFile("file")
    if err != nil {
        c.String(http.StatusBadRequest, "Bad Request")
        return
    }
    if err := c.SaveUploadedFile(file, "/uploads/" + file.Filename); err != nil {
        c.String(http.StatusInternalServerError, "Internal Server Error")
        return
    }
    c.String(http.StatusOK, "Upload successful")
})
```

**Detection Rule Criteria:**
- Look for `c.FormFile` or `c.SaveUploadedFile`
- Validate usage of `file.Filename` without validating its contents, size, and type

#### 3. Echo Web Framework

**Insecure Pattern:**
```go
e.POST("/upload", func(c echo.Context) error {
    file, err := c.FormFile("file")
    if err != nil {
        return echo.NewHTTPError(http.StatusBadRequest, "Bad Request")
    }
    src, err := file.Open()
    if err != nil {
        return echo.NewHTTPError(http.StatusInternalServerError, "Internal Server Error")
    }
    defer src.Close()

    dst, err := os.Create("/uploads/" + file.Filename)
    if err != nil {
        return echo.NewHTTPError(http.StatusInternalServerError, "Internal Server Error")
    }
    defer dst.Close()

    if _, err = io.Copy(dst, src); err != nil {
        return echo.NewHTTPError(http.StatusInternalServerError, "Internal Server Error")
    }
    return c.String(http.StatusOK, "Upload successful")
})
```

**Detection Rule Criteria:**
- Look for `c.FormFile` or `file.Open`
- Check if filenames are used without validation of file type and size

### Additional Considerations

To minimize false positives and false negatives:
- Combine filename checks with MIME type and file signature checks.
- Ensure checking for the implementation of default file extension validations in common libraries used within Go frameworks.
- Trigger rule only when the combination of missing checks (filename, MIME type, and file signature) is found.

By understanding these patterns and integrating robust validation checks into your SAST rules, you can significantly reduce the risk of Unrestricted File Upload vulnerabilities in Go applications.
