# Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) (CWE-918) in Python

#### Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) 

### Overview of SSRF
Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) is a vulnerability that occurs when an attacker can make a server-side application send HTTP requests to an arbitrary domain of their choosing. This type of attack usually happens when the server does not validate or sanitize user inputs properly, allowing the crafted URL to be processed. The attacker can exploit this to:

1. **Access Internal Systems**: SSRF can be used to scan and access internal services that are not accessible externally.
2. **Sensitive Data Exposure**: It can be used to fetch sensitive data, e.g., internal application files.
3. **Metadata Exploitation**: Access metadata services on cloud providers (e.g., AWS metadata service).
4. **Compromise Internal Services**: Perform further attacks like Remote Code Execution (RCE) or Denial of Service (DoS)【4:0†source】  .

### Common SSRF Scenarios in Python

#### 1. Flask Framework
Flask is a lightweight WSGI web application framework in Python. Here is a basic example of SSRF vulnerability:

```python
from flask import Flask, request
import requests

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/fetch', methods=['GET'])
def fetch():
    url = request.args.get('url')
    response = requests.get(url)  # SSRF vulnerability: unvalidated user input being used to make a request.
    return response.text

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()
```

#### 2. Django Framework
Django is a high-level Python Web framework. Below is an example of a vulnerable piece of code in Django:

```python
from django.http import HttpResponse
import requests

def fetch(request):
    url = request.GET.get('url')
    response = requests.get(url)  # SSRF vulnerability: unvalidated user input being used to make a request.
    return HttpResponse(response.text)
```

#### 3. Pyramid Framework
Pyramid is another framework that can be vulnerable to SSRF:

```python
from pyramid.view import view_config
import requests

@view_config(route_name='fetch')
def fetch(request):
    url = request.params.get('url')
    response = requests.get(url)  # SSRF vulnerability: unvalidated user input being used to make a request.
    return response.text
```

#### 4. Tornado Framework
A framework for building asynchronous web services, which can also be affected:

```python
import tornado.ioloop
import tornado.web
import requests

class MainHandler(tornado.web.RequestHandler):
    def get(self):
        url = self.get_argument('url')
        response = requests.get(url)  # SSRF vulnerability: unvalidated user input being used to make a request.
        self.write(response.text)

application = tornado.web.Application([
    (r"/fetch", MainHandler),
])

if __name__ == "__main__":
    application.listen(8888)
    tornado.ioloop.IOLoop.instance().start()
```

### Key Patterns for SAST Rule Development

To detect SSRF vulnerabilities, one must look for patterns where user input directly influences network or file system requests without validation. Here are the generalized steps to create an effective SAST rule:

1. **Identify Functions Making External Requests**: Look for the usage of functions like `requests.get`, `urllib.request.urlopen`, `httplib2.Http().request`, etc.
2. **Trace User Input**: Analyze whether the input parameters from functions like `request.GET.get`, `request.args.get`, `self.get_argument`, etc., are being used in the URL request functions.
3. **Check for Lack of Input Validation**: Ensure that the inputs are being validated properly, such as using a whitelist of allowed domains or patterns.
4. **Flag Direct Use**: If user inputs are directly used in making external requests without sanitization or validation, alert for possible SSRF.

By focusing on these patterns and including context-aware static code analysis, the detection rules can achieve greater accuracy. For more insights on SSRF and prevention techniques, refer to the OWASP SSRF Prevention Cheat Sheet .

### Conclusion

SSRF is a serious security flaw that can be present in various Python frameworks when handling external resource fetching without proper validation. Understanding the contexts, how it can manifest in Python applications, and the development of accurate SAST rules are essential steps towards detecting and mitigating this vulnerability effectively【4:0†source】.
