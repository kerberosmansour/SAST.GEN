# Uncontrolled Resource Consumption (CWE-400) in Python

###### Understanding Uncontrolled Resource Consumption

#### Definition
Uncontrolled Resource Consumption occurs when an application allows users to consume resources such as CPU, memory, bandwidth, or disk space without any restrictions or limits, potentially leading to resource exhaustion. This can result in Denial of Service (DoS) attacks, where the application becomes unresponsive because it no longer has sufficient resources to process legitimate requests   .

#### Key Variations

Uncontrolled Resource Consumption can manifest in several ways:
1. **CPU Exhaustion**: Running CPU-intensive operations without limits.
2. **Memory Leaks/Overuse**: Consuming memory without deallocation.
3. **Disk Space Utilization**: Large file uploads or logs consuming disk space.
4. **Network Bandwidth Consumption**: Excessive data transfer.
5. **Thread Pool Exhaustion**: Creating too many threads leading to thread starvation.

### Examples in Python across Various Frameworks

#### 1. Flask: CPU Exhaustion with Unrestricted Computational Tasks

**Vulnerable Code:**
```python
from flask import Flask, request

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/compute', methods=['GET'])
def compute():
    n = int(request.args.get('n'))
    result = [x**2 for x in range(n)]  # Heavy computation
    return str(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run()
```
**Explanation:** Here, a user can specify a very large value for `n`, leading to excessive CPU usage.

**Detection Strategy for SAST:**
- Identify routes handling input parameters.
- Check for large loops or intensive computations based on user inputs.
- Example pattern: `range(user_input)` inside a route handler.

#### 2. Django: Memory Exhaustion with Large Data Handling

**Vulnerable Code:**
```python
from django.http import JsonResponse
from django.views import View
import json

class LargeDataView(View):
    def get(self, request):
        data = json.loads(request.GET.get('data'))
        processed_data = [json.dumps(item) for item in data]  # Large memory usage
        return JsonResponse({'processed': processed_data})
```
**Explanation:** Loading and processing a massive JSON payload can lead to memory exhaustion.

**Detection Strategy for SAST:**
- Identify `json.loads()` or similar functions.
- Track size of data parameters, flag unusually large data being processed.

#### 3. FastAPI: Disk Space Exhaustion with Unrestricted File Uploads

**Vulnerable Code:**
```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, File, UploadFile

app = FastAPI()

@app.post("/uploadfile/")
async def create_upload_file(file: UploadFile = File(...)):
    content = await file.read()
    with open(f'/uploads/{file.filename}', 'wb') as f:
        f.write(content)
    return {"filename": file.filename}
```
**Explanation:** Unrestricted file upload without size checks can fill the disk.

**Detection Strategy for SAST:**
- Detect `UploadFile` and `File()` usage.
- Identify if file size is restricted or not.

#### 4. Tornado: Network Bandwidth Exhaustion

**Vulnerable Code:**
```python
import tornado.ioloop
import tornado.web

class MainHandler(tornado.web.RequestHandler):
    def get(self):
        url = self.get_argument("url")
        response = requests.get(url)
        self.write(response.content)

def make_app():
    return tornado.web.Application([
        (r"/fetch", MainHandler),
    ])

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app = make_app()
    app.listen(8888)
    tornado.ioloop.IOLoop.current().start()
```
**Explanation:** Fetching large external content without bandwidth limiting can abuse network resources.

**Detection Strategy for SAST:**
- Identify outbound network operations in response handlers.
- Check for rate limiting or size checks.

#### 5. Pyramid: Thread Pool and Session Exhaustion 

**Vulnerable Code:**
```python
from pyramid.view import view_config
from pyramid.response import Response

@view_config(route_name='long_task')
def long_task_view(request):
    import time
    time.sleep(10)  # Simulate long task
    return Response('Task Complete')

if __name__ == "__main__":
    with Configurator() as config:
        config.add_route('long_task', '/long_task')
        config.scan()
        app = config.make_wsgi_app()
    server = make_server('0.0.0.0', 6543, app)
    server.serve_forever()
```
**Explanation:** Long-running tasks without proper session timeout can exhaust thread pool or session resources.

**Detection Strategy for SAST:**
- Identify long-running tasks (`time.sleep()`, extensive database operations).
- Check for configurable timeouts.

### Detailed Detection Rule Guidelines

1. **Pattern Matching:**
   - Identify potentially expensive operations like `json.loads()`, loops with large ranges, recursive calls, and external resource fetching.
   - Cross-reference these operations with user inputs to determine if they may be unbounded.

2. **Resource Limit Checks:**
   - Ensure there are limits on input size, request count, data processing sizes.
   - Validate that timeouts for tasks and sessions are properly set.

3. **Code Flow Analysis:**
   - Perform a data flow analysis to see how data moves through the application.
   - Flag any endpoints or functions that could be abused for resource exhaustion.

4. **Static Analysis for Security Best Practices:**
   - Implement Static Analysis patterns to prevent these conditions by including security best practices like input validation, rate limiting, and task timeouts.

By focusing on these different variations and the detailed detection rules, the SAST tool can have a higher chance of identifying potential Uncontrolled Resource Consumption vulnerabilities while minimizing false positives    .
