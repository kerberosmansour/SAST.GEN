# Uncontrolled Search Path Element (CWE-427) in Python

###### Explanation of Uncontrolled Search Path Element (CWE-426)

**Uncontrolled Search Path Element** is a security vulnerability that occurs when a program does not properly control the directories that are searched for resources such as program libraries or executable files. This can lead to a situation where an attacker can place malicious files in a directory that will be searched by the vulnerable program, leading to execution of the attackerâ€™s code instead of the intended resource.

### How CWE-426 Occurs in Python

In Python, `CWE-426: Untrusted Search Path` can manifest in several ways, as Python applications often rely on dynamically loading modules and interacting with the file system. Here are some common scenarios and variations in different frameworks:

#### 1. Untrusted Search Path in Environment Variables
Uncontrolled search paths can occur if the application uses environment variables (like `PYTHONPATH`) to load modules without proper sanitization:

```python
import os
import sys

# Vulnerable code: Modifying sys.path based on an environment variable
sys.path.insert(0, os.environ['PYTHONPATH'])

import some_module
```

#### 2. Use of `os.exec` and `subprocess` Modules
Improper use of `os.exec*` or `subprocess` functions that rely on the system PATH variable:

```python
import os

# Vulnerable code: Using os.system without specifying full path
os.system('some_command')

# Vulnerable code: Using subprocess without specifying full path
import subprocess
subprocess.run(['some_command'])
```

Attackers can exploit these by manipulating the system PATH environment variable.

#### 3. Loading Modules Using `importlib`

Using `importlib` to dynamically import modules based on user input can lead to an uncontrolled search path issue:

```python
import importlib

# Vulnerable code: dynamic import based on user input
module_name = input("Enter the module name to import: ")
module = importlib.import_module(module_name)
```

An attacker could provide a path to a malicious module.

#### 4. Django Framework
In Django, if the `settings.py` or any other configuration is loaded based on environment variables or user-controlled paths:

```python
# Vulnerable code: loading settings from potentially unsafe location
import os
config_path = os.environ['DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE']
os.environ.setdefault('DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE', config_path)
```

#### 5. Flask Framework
Flask application may use dynamic paths for loading configurations or static files that can be tainted:

```python
from flask import Flask, request, send_from_directory

app = Flask(__name__)

# Vulnerable code: sending files from a directory specified by user
@app.route('/files/<path:filename>')
def download_file(filename):
    directory = request.args.get('directory', '/default/path')
    return send_from_directory(directory, filename)
```

An attacker can specify a directory that contains malicious files.

#### 6. PyInstaller or Other Packagers
In compiled Python applications using tools like PyInstaller, make sure to not rely on untrusted directories for dependencies:

```bash
# Make sure paths in .spec files or during the build process are controlled and sanitized
```

### SAST Tool Detection Rules

For a SAST tool, detection of `CWE-426` in Python requires identifying patterns where untrusted data can influence the search path or the execution of system commands. Here are some rules to detect these scenarios:

1. **Environment Variable Path Insertion:**
   - Check for the use of `sys.path.insert` or `sys.path.append` where the path is influenced by environment variables.

2. **Usage of `os.exec` and `subprocess`:**
   - Flag instances where `os.system`, `os.exec*`, or `subprocess` calls are made without specifying the full path of the executable.
   
3. **Dynamic Imports:**
   - Detect dynamic imports using `__import__`, `importlib.import_module`, or `exec` based on tainted input.

4. **Configuration Loading in Django:**
   - Identify dynamic setting loads in Django applications via `os.environ` or similar means.

5. **File Handling in Flask:**
   - Look for `send_from_directory`, `send_file`, or similar file-serving functions where the path is derived from user input.

6. **Uncontrolled Paths in PyInstaller:**
   - Inspect build scripts and specifications for paths influenced by environment or user input.

### Examples in SAST Tool Rules Format

Here are potential SAST rules in a pseudo-SAST syntax format:

- **Rule 1: Environment Variable Path Insertion**
  ```sast
  rule_id: CWE-426_ENV_PATH_INSERTION
  pattern: sys.path.insert(0, os.environ['\w+'])
  ```

- **Rule 2: Usage of `os.system` and `subprocess`**
  ```sast
  rule_id: CWE-426_OS_SYSTEM_UNSAFE
  pattern: os.system('\w+')
  pattern: subprocess.run(['\w+'])
  ```

- **Rule 3: Dynamic Imports**
  ```sast
  rule_id: CWE-426_DYNAMIC_IMPORT
  pattern: importlib.import_module(.*input.*)
  pattern: __import__\(.*input.*\)
  ```

- **Rule 4: Django Configuration Loading**
  ```sast
  rule_id: CWE-426_DJANGO_CONFIG
  pattern: os.environ.setdefault('DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE', .*)
  ```

- **Rule 5: Flask File Handling**
  ```sast
  rule_id: CWE-426_FLASK_FILE_SERVE
  pattern: send_from_directory(request.args.get('directory', .*))
  ```

- **Rule 6: Uncontrolled Paths in PyInstaller**
  ```sast
  rule_id: CWE-426_PYINSTALLER_PATH
  pattern: .spec
  ```

By incorporating these rules in a SAST tool, you can effectively identify and highlight instances of uncontrolled search path elements with a reduced rate of false positives and false negatives.
