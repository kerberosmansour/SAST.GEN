# Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an Expression Language Statement ('Expression Language Injection') (CWE-917) in Python

###### Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an Expression Language Statement (Expression Language Injection)

Expression Language Injection (EL Injection) is a type of security vulnerability that occurs when an application receives untrusted data and uses it to evaluate an expression. This can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code or access sensitive data. The root cause of this vulnerability is the failure to properly neutralize special elements that are used within expressions.

For Python specifically, Expression Language Injection can be seen in multiple contexts and frameworks. Here are different scenarios and examples to help in writing detection rules for a Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tool:

### General Python
Python's `eval()` function can evaluate arbitrary expressions passed to it. An improper use of `eval()` with untrusted input can lead to EL Injection.

```python
# Dangerous usage of eval with user input
def evaluate_expression(user_input):
    # directly using user input in eval is dangerous
    result = eval(user_input)
    return result

# Example of an unsafe call
user_input = "2 + 2"
print(evaluate_expression(user_input))  # This is unsafe
```

### Flask Framework
Flask is a popular web framework for Python. While Flask itself does not have an expression language parser, developers might inadvertently create one using `eval()`.

```python
from flask import Flask, request

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/eval')
def eval_route():
    expression = request.args.get('expression')
    return str(eval(expression))  # Unsafe usage of eval

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()
```

### Jinja2 Templating Engine
Jinja2 is the default templating engine in Flask and can execute dynamically evaluated expressions. If not used cautiously, it can lead to template injection attacks.

```python
from jinja2 import Template

@app.route('/template')
def template_route():
    template_str = "{{ " + request.args.get('expression') + " }}"
    template = Template(template_str)
    return template.render()  # Unsafe rendering of user input
```

### Django Framework
Django, another popular Python web framework, also potentially has points where EL Injection could happen, particularly if developers misuse the templating engine.

```python
from django.http import HttpResponse
from django.template import Template, Context

def unsafe_template_view(request):
    template_str = request.GET.get('expression', '')
    template = Template(template_str)
    context = Context({})
    return HttpResponse(template.render(context))  # Unsafe rendering
```

### Detection and Prevention

To write effective SAST rules for detecting EL Injection in Python across different frameworks, consider the following approaches:

1. **Identify Usage of Dangerous Functions:**
   - `eval()` and `exec()` should be scrutinized with user-supplied inputs. Any direct use with user-controlled data should be flagged.
   - Example Rule:
     ```python
     import re

     code = '...'

     # Detect eval with potentially unsafe user input
     if re.search(r'\beval\s*\(.*request\..*\)', code):
         print("Potential EL Injection with eval detected")

     # Detect exec with potentially unsafe user input
     if re.search(r'\bexec\s*\(.*request\..*\)', code):
         print("Potential EL Injection with exec detected")
     ```

2. **Template Engines:**
   - Ensure that user inputs are not directly rendered in templates without proper sanitization or escaping.
   - Example Rule for Jinja2:
     ```python
     # Detect potential Jinja2 template injection
     if re.search(r'\{\{\s*request\..*\s*\}\}', code):
         print("Potential Jinja2 Template Injection detected")
     ```

3. **Framework-Specific Patterns:**
   - Look for framework-specific methods that might lead to EL Injection.
   - Example Rule for Django:
     ```python
     # Detect unsafe template rendering in Django
     if re.search(r'Template\(.*request\..*\)', code):
         print("Potential Django Template Injection detected")
     ```

4. **Custom Expression Evaluators:**
   - If custom expression evaluation logic is implemented, these should also be reviewed.
   - Direct calls to any custom methods handling expressions need to be assessed for potential untrusted input usage.

### Summary

Expression Language Injection in Python can manifest in different forms across various frameworks like Flask and Django. While writing SAST rules, focus on identifying unsafe usage of `eval()`, `exec()`, and template rendering methods that might take user input directly. These rules should help in minimizing false negatives while ensuring that the detection rates remain high, thus securing the application from such vulnerabilities.

Given examples and targeted rules can significantly reduce the chances of EL Injection vulnerabilities slipping through undetected【4:0†source】【4:6†source】 .
