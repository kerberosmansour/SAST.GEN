# Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal') (CWE-022) in Python

###### Explanation of Path Traversal Vulnerabilities

**Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')**, also known as Directory Traversal, occurs when an application fails to properly validate user input that might influence file paths. By manipulating variables that reference files using sequences like `../` (dot-dot-slash), attackers can access restricted directories and execute arbitrary commands or view sensitive data such as configuration files or password files.

For example, if an application allows users to download files based on user input but does not validate that input properly, users could specify a path that goes up the directory tree and accesses sensitive files outside the intended directory. This type of vulnerability can lead to severe security risks, including unauthorized access to the system's file contents.

### Python Code Examples of Path Traversal

Let's explore various examples of how path traversal vulnerabilities can occur in Python applications across different popular frameworks:

**1. Standard Python Code**

```python
import os

def read_file(filename):
    with open(filename, 'r') as file:
        return file.read()

# Usage
filename = input("Enter the filename: ") 
print(read_file(filename))
```

In this example, a user could input `../../etc/passwd` and access sensitive system files.

**2. Flask Framework**

Flask is a popular web framework in Python. Here's an example of an insecure file download feature:

```python
from flask import Flask, request, send_from_directory

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/download')
def download_file():
    filename = request.args.get('filename')
    directory = "/path/to/directory"
    return send_from_directory(directory, filename)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()
```

A malicious URL like `/download?filename=../../etc/passwd` could allow an attacker to access the `passwd` file.

**3. Django Framework**

Django is another powerful Python web framework. Below is an example where user input is directly used to build a file path without sufficient validation:

```python
from django.http import HttpResponse
import os

def file_view(request):
    filename = request.GET.get('filename')
    base_path = '/path/to/files'
    file_path = os.path.join(base_path, filename)
    
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        return HttpResponse(file.read(), content_type='text/plain')
```

This code can be exploited by providing an input like `../../etc/passwd` in the `filename` parameter to read arbitrary files.

### Mitigation Techniques

To prevent path traversal vulnerabilities, ensure that input is properly sanitized and validated. Consider the following best practices:

- **Use Whitelisting:** Only allow predefined acceptable file paths.
- **Normalize Path:** Use functions such as `os.path.normpath()` and `os.path.abspath()` to convert input paths to absolute paths and check if they reside within the intended directory.
- **Avoid User Input in File Paths:** Avoid using raw user input for constructing file paths.

**Example of Secure Implementation in Flask:**

```python
from flask import Flask, request, send_from_directory, abort
import os

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/download')
def download_file():
    filename = request.args.get('filename')
    directory = "/path/to/directory"
    full_path = os.path.join(directory, filename)
    
    # Ensure the final path is within the intended directory
    if not os.path.commonprefix([full_path, directory]) == directory:
        return abort(400, "Invalid path")
    
    return send_from_directory(directory, filename)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()
```

**Example of Secure Implementation in Django:**

```python
from django.http import HttpResponse, HttpResponseBadRequest
import os

def file_view(request):
    filename = request.GET.get('filename')
    base_path = '/path/to/files'
    file_path = os.path.join(base_path, filename)
    
    # Ensure the path is secure and within the intended directory
    if not os.path.commonprefix([os.path.realpath(file_path), base_path]) == base_path:
        return HttpResponseBadRequest("Invalid path")
    
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        return HttpResponse(file.read(), content_type='text/plain')
```

### SAST Rule Implementation Guidance

To implement Static Application Security Testing (SAST) rules for detecting path traversal vulnerabilities, look for:

- File path concatenation using user inputs.
- Methods like `os.path.join`, `send_from_directory` (for Flask), and similar invocations where user input influences file paths.
- The absence of validation checks on paths (beyond basic checks like `if` statements for bad characters).

Ensure the SAST tool can parse and interpret various ways developers may use libraries or string concatenation involving file paths.

By incorporating these checks and validations, you can significantly reduce the risk of path traversal attacks in Python applications.
