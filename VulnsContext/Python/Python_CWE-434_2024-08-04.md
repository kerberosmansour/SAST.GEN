# Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type (CWE-434) in Python

###### Understanding Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type

Unrestricted upload vulnerabilities occur when an application allows the upload of files without sufficient validation or restriction on the file type, name, or content. This can potentially allow attackers to upload harmful files, leading to various security issues such as code execution, server compromise, data leakage, denial of service (DoS), and client-side attacks like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)【4:0†source】【4:1†source】【4:2†source】【4:3†source】【4:4†source】.

### Key Security Measures

1. **Extension Validation**: Validate file extensions at the server-side after decoding the file name to avoid bypasses like double extensions (e.g., .jpg.php) and null bytes (e.g., .php%00.jpg).
2. **Content-Type Validation**: Ensure that MIME types are validated at the server-side, even though they can be easily spoofed by the user.
3. **File Signature Validation**: Verify the file's signature to ensure that it matches the expected file type【4:0†source】【4:1†source】【4:4†source】.

### Examples of Unrestricted Upload in Python

#### Flask
In Flask, file uploads are typically handled using the `request.files` dictionary. An unrestricted upload might look like:

```python
from flask import Flask, request
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/upload', methods=['POST'])
def upload_file():
    file = request.files['file']
    file.save(f"/uploads/{file.filename}")
    return "File uploaded successfully"
```

*Potential Exploit*: The above code allows any file to be uploaded, potentially leading to code execution if a `.php` or `.exe` file is uploaded.

**Secure Implementation**:
```python
from flask import Flask, request
import os

app = Flask(__name__)
ALLOWED_EXTENSIONS = {'png', 'jpg', 'jpeg', 'gif'}
UPLOAD_FOLDER = '/uploads'

def allowed_file(filename):
    return '.' in filename and \
           filename.rsplit('.', 1)[1].lower() in ALLOWED_EXTENSIONS

@app.route('/upload', methods=['POST'])
def upload_file():
    file = request.files['file']
    if file and allowed_file(file.filename):
        filename = secure_filename(file.filename)
        file.save(os.path.join(UPLOAD_FOLDER, filename))
        return "File uploaded successfully"
    else:
        return "Invalid file type"
```
#### Django
In Django, file uploads are handled using FileField or ImageField within models and forms.

*Potential Exploit*:
```python
from django.http import HttpResponse
from django.shortcuts import render
from django.core.files.storage import FileSystemStorage

def upload(request):
    if request.method == 'POST' and request.FILES['file']:
        file = request.FILES['file']
        fs = FileSystemStorage()
        filename = fs.save(file.name, file)
        return HttpResponse('File uploaded successfully')
    return render(request, 'upload.html')
```

*Exploitation*: The above code allows the upload of any file type.

**Secure Implementation**:
```python
from django.core.files.storage import FileSystemStorage
from django.http import HttpResponse
from django.shortcuts import render

ALLOWED_EXTENSIONS = {'png', 'jpg', 'jpeg', 'gif'}

def upload(request):
    if request.method == 'POST' and request.FILES['file']:
        file = request.FILES['file']
        if file.name.split(".")[-1].lower() in ALLOWED_EXTENSIONS:
            fs = FileSystemStorage()
            filename = fs.save(file.name, file)
            return HttpResponse('File uploaded successfully')
        else:
            return HttpResponse("Invalid file type")
    return render(request, 'upload.html')
```

#### FastAPI
FastAPI can manage file uploads using `UploadFile` type.

*Potential Exploit*:
```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, File, UploadFile
import shutil

app = FastAPI()

@app.post("/upload")
async def upload_file(file: UploadFile = File(...)):
    with open(f"/uploads/{file.filename}", "wb") as buffer:
        shutil.copyfileobj(file.file, buffer)
    return {"filename": file.filename}
```

*Exploitation*: The code allows any file type to be uploaded.

**Secure Implementation**:
```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, File, UploadFile, HTTPException
import shutil

app = FastAPI()
ALLOWED_EXTENSIONS = {'png', 'jpg', 'jpeg', 'gif'}

def allowed_file(filename):
    return '.' in filename and \
           filename.rsplit('.', 1)[1].lower() in ALLOWED_EXTENSIONS

@app.post("/upload")
async def upload_file(file: UploadFile = File(...)):
    if not allowed_file(file.filename):
        raise HTTPException(status_code=400, detail="Invalid file type")
    with open(f"/uploads/{file.filename}", "wb") as buffer:
        shutil.copyfileobj(file.file, buffer)
    return {"filename": file.filename}
```

### Writing SAST Rules
1. **File Extension**: Detect cases where the file extension is not being validated. Look for code patterns that use `request.files` or equivalents and save files with minimal or no validation.
2. **Content-Type**: Check for MIME type checks and ensure they are being validated correctly. Warn when MIME types are not checked before saving.
3. **Filename**: Flag instances where filenames are being directly used without sanitization.
4. **Contextual Analysis**: Identify if the files are being saved in publicly accessible directories.

### Conclusion
Detecting unrestricted file uploads requires ensuring that filenames, extensions, and file content are thoroughly validated and sanitized. The SAST rules should be designed to catch instances where such validations are missing or improperly implemented to ensure a reliable and secure application.
