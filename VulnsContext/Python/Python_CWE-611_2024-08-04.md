# Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference (CWE-611) in Python

###### Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference (XXE)

**Definition**:
Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference, commonly known as XXE, is a vulnerability that occurs when an application processes XML input containing a reference to an external entity, causing the XML parser to evaluate entities within the XML input. If not properly secured, this can lead to various attack scenarios including but not limited to:

- Disclosure of confidential data
- Server-side request forgery (SSRF) that can be used to access internal systems
- Denial of Service (DoS) by leveraging entities to loop or expand exponentially
- Potential remote code execution in certain configurations

This vulnerability is cataloged under [CWE-611](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/611.html) and highlights the importance of configuring XML parsers securely   .

### General Guidelines to Prevent XXE:

**Disable DTDs (External Entities)**:
The safest way to prevent XXE attacks is by disabling DTDs completely. For instance:
```java
factory.setFeature("http://apache.org/xml/features/disallow-doctype-decl", true);
```

**Disable External Entities**:
If disabling DTDs is not possible, it is important to disable the loading of external entities using parser-specific configuration options.

### Common Libraries/Frameworks in Python and Examples:

#### 1. **Python Standard Library (`xml.etree.ElementTree`)**

**Vulnerable Code Example**:
```python
import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET

xml_data = """
    <!DOCTYPE root [
    <!ELEMENT root ANY >
    <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd" >]><root>&xxe;</root>
"""
tree = ET.ElementTree(ET.fromstring(xml_data))
```

**Secure Configuration**:
The `xml.etree.ElementTree` does not provide a built-in way to disable DTD resolution. Therefore, it is recommended to not use this library if you are processing untrusted XML. Instead, use `defusedxml`.

```python
import defusedxml.ElementTree as ET

xml_data = "<root>some XML data</root>"
tree = ET.ElementTree(ET.fromstring(xml_data))
```

#### 2. **`lxml` Library**

**Vulnerable Code Example**:
```python
from lxml import etree

xml_data = """
    <!DOCTYPE root [
    <!ELEMENT root ANY >
    <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd" >]><root>&xxe;</root>
"""
tree = etree.fromstring(xml_data)
```

**Secure Configuration**:
```python
from lxml import etree

parser = etree.XMLParser(resolve_entities=False)
xml_data = "<root>some XML data</root>"
tree = etree.fromstring(xml_data, parser=parser)
```

#### 3. **`minidom` from `xml.dom`**

**Vulnerable Code Example**:
```python
from xml.dom import minidom

xml_data = """
    <!DOCTYPE root [
    <!ELEMENT root ANY >
    <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd" >]><root>&xxe;</root>
"""
dom = minidom.parseString(xml_data)
```

**Secure Configuration**:
Similar to `ElementTree`, `minidom` does not have a straightforward way to disable DTD loading. Use `defusedxml.minidom`.

```python
from defusedxml.minidom import parseString

xml_data = "<root>some XML data</root>"
dom = parseString(xml_data)
```

#### 4. **`xml.sax`**

**Vulnerable Code Example**:
```python
import xml.sax

class MyHandler(xml.sax.ContentHandler):
    def characters(self, content):
        print(content)

xml_data = """
    <!DOCTYPE root [
    <!ELEMENT root ANY >
    <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd" >]><root>&xxe;</root>
"""

xml.sax.parseString(xml_data, MyHandler())
```

**Secure Configuration**:
```python
import xml.sax
import defusedxml.sax

class MyHandler(xml.sax.ContentHandler):
    def characters(self, content):
        print(content)

xml_data = "<root>some XML data</root>"
defusedxml.sax.parseString(xml_data, MyHandler())
```

### Writing SAST Rules:

When creating SAST (Static Application Security Testing) rules to detect XXE vulnerabilities in Python code, consider the following guidelines to achieve high precision (low false positives) and recall (low false negatives):

1. **Identify XML Parsers**:
   - Detect the use of `xml.etree.ElementTree`, `lxml`, `xml.dom.minidom`, `xml.sax`, and other XML-processing libraries.

2. **Check for Secure Configurations**:
   - For `lxml`, look for `XMLParser(resolve_entities=False)` usage.
   - For `xml.etree.ElementTree` and other libraries without secure options, recommend using `defusedxml`.
   - Ensure no direct usage of `xml.dom.minidom` or `xml.etree.ElementTree` with external DTDs.

3. **Recommendations**:
   - Automatically suggest alternative safe libraries such as `defusedxml`.

4. **Patterns and Conditions**:
   - Detect patterns where XML data strings contain `<!DOCTYPE` declarations and the parser settings do not disable entity resolution.
   - Identify default parser configurations that do not secure against XXE by disabling entity resolution and external DTD loading.

5. **Testing**:
   - Implement unit tests to cover various scenarios (correct/incorrect configurations).

By following these guidelines and focusing on parser-specific features and secure configurations, SAST tools can effectively detect XXE vulnerabilities in Python applications.
