# Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection') (CWE-078) in Python

###### Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')

**Definition:**
Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command (also known as OS Command Injection) is a vulnerability that occurs when an application constructs a system command using input from an external source without proper validation or sanitization. This allows an attacker to manipulate or execute unintended commands on the system, which can lead to a variety of malicious activities ranging from information disclosure to full remote code execution【4:0†source】  .

**Explanation:**
When user input is directly used to construct a command line that is executed by the operating system, attackers can inject additional commands or alter the behavior of the intended command. For example, a benign command like `ping 192.168.1.1` can be turned into a malicious one like `ping 192.168.1.1 && rm -rf /` if the user input is not properly sanitized.

### Variations and Examples in Python

Python is widely used in various types of applications, including web applications using frameworks such as Django, Flask, and FastAPI. Here are some examples and variations of OS command injection in Python, along with methods to detect them.

#### 1. Basic OS Command Injection Using `os.system`

```python
import os

user_input = "192.168.1.1; rm -rf /"
os.system(f"ping {user_input}")  # Vulnerable to command injection
```

#### 2. Command Injection Using `subprocess`

```python
import subprocess

user_input = "192.168.1.1; rm -rf /"
subprocess.call(f"ping {user_input}", shell=True)  # Vulnerable to command injection
```

#### 3. Command Injection in Django Application

```python
from django.http import HttpResponse
import os

def ping(request):
    ip_address = request.GET.get('ip', '127.0.0.1')
    os.system(f"ping {ip_address}")  # Vulnerable to command injection
    return HttpResponse("Ping executed")
```

#### 4. Command Injection in Flask Application

```python
from flask import Flask, request
import subprocess

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/ping', methods=['GET'])
def ping():
    ip_address = request.args.get('ip', '127.0.0.1')
    subprocess.run(f"ping {ip_address}", shell=True)  # Vulnerable to command injection
    return "Ping executed"
```

### Key Points for SAST Rule Detection

To create effective SAST detection rules with limited false positives and negatives, consider the following:

1. **Identify Command Execution Functions:**
   - Look for functions or methods like `os.system`, `subprocess.call`, `subprocess.run`, `os.popen`, etc.
   
2. **Check for Untrusted Inputs:**
   - Trace the data flow to identify if user input or external data sources are used in constructing the commands.

3. **Use of `shell=True`:**
   - Commands executed with `shell=True` are particularly susceptible to injection attacks because the shell interprets the command string.

4. **Lack of Parameterization:**
   - Check if the command is constructed using string concatenation or interpolation rather than using safe APIs that separate commands from parameters.

5. **Mitigate False Positives:**
   - Whitelist commands and parameters when possible, and ensure that validated or sanitized data is used.

### Examples of SAST Detection Rules

```python
# Pseudocode for SAST Detection Rule

def detect_command_injection(node):
    if node.type in ["Call"]:
        func_name = get_function_name(node)
        if func_name in ["os.system", "subprocess.call", "subprocess.run", "os.popen"]:
            if "shell=True" in node.arguments:
                if is_untrusted_input(node.arguments):
                    report_vulnerability(node, "Possible OS Command Injection")

def get_function_name(node):
    # Extracts the function name from the AST node
    pass

def is_untrusted_input(arguments):
    # Checks if any argument originates from user input or external sources
    pass

def report_vulnerability(node, message):
    # Reports the detected vulnerability
    pass
```

### Conclusion

By understanding the different variations of OS Command Injection and implementing detection rules based on function identification, parameter validation, and data source tracking, it is possible to create effective SAST rules to identify and mitigate the risks associated with this vulnerability. Remember to always apply proper sanitization and validation when handling user inputs, and prefer using safe APIs and parameterization techniques over direct command execution.
