# Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection') (CWE-089) in Python

****Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command (SQL Injection)**

### Overview

Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command, known as SQL Injection (SQLi), is a security vulnerability that occurs when an attacker is able to manipulate the SQL queries executed by an application. This exploitation allows the attacker to read, modify, or delete data within the database circumventing the application's intended behavior.

SQL Injection can occur when user input is incorrectly handled and incorporated directly into SQL queries. Common causes include: 

1. Concatenation of user inputs directly into SQL queries without proper sanitization.
2. Incorrect parameterization techniques.

### Preventive Measures

- **Use of Safe APIs:** Using prepared statements and parameterized queries which prevent direct concatenation of user inputs.
- **Input Validation:** Performing positive input validation on the server-side.
- **Escaping Special Characters:** If dynamic queries are used, escaping special characters appropriately for the SQL interpreter.

Refer to the OWASP resources for secure database access, input validation, and SQL Injection testing:

### Examples and Variations in Python

#### 1. SQL Injection in Plain Python with SQLite
```python
import sqlite3

def get_user_info(user_id):
    conn = sqlite3.connect('example.db')
    cursor = conn.cursor()
    query = f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = {user_id};"
    cursor.execute(query)  # Potentially dangerous
    return cursor.fetchall()
```

#### 2. SQL Injection with MySQL Connector
```python
import mysql.connector

def get_user_info(user_id):
    conn = mysql.connector.connect(user='user', password='password', host='host', database='db')
    cursor = conn.cursor()
    query = f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = {user_id};"
    cursor.execute(query)  # Potential SQL injection vulnerability
    return cursor.fetchall()
```

#### 3. SQL Injection in Django
```python
from django.db import connection

def get_user_info(user_id):
    with connection.cursor() as cursor:
        cursor.execute(f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = {user_id};")  # Vulnerability here
        rows = cursor.fetchall()
    return rows
```

#### 4. SQL Injection in SQLAlchemy
```python
from sqlalchemy import create_engine, text

engine = create_engine('sqlite:///example.db')

def get_user_info(user_id):
    with engine.connect() as conn:
        result = conn.execute(text(f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = :user_id"), {'user_id': user_id})  # Correct parameterization
        return result.fetchall()
```

### Detection Rules for SAST Tools

A Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tool should consider the following detection rules:

1. **String Concatenation Patterns:**
   - Identify string concatenations used within SQL query definitions, especially when user inputs are directly incorporated.
   - Example: Use regex to find patterns like `f"SELECT ... {user_input} ..."`, `"SELECT ... " + user_input + ...`

2. **Raw SQL Execution:**
   - Detect the use of raw SQL execution functions such as `execute` without proper parameterization.
   - Example: Identify `cursor.execute(query)` patterns where `query` is a dynamically constructed string.

3. **Framework-Specific Patterns:**
   - For Django: Look for direct executions using `cursor.execute(query)`
   - For SQLAlchemy: Ensure `text` and other constructs are parameterized correctly.
   - Database Connection Objects: Identify patterns across various database connectors (MySQL Connector, SQLite).

By implementing the above rules, a SAST tool can significantly reduce false negatives while maintaining a reasonable rate of false positives. Detailed analysis and testing should ensure the tool's accuracy in different use cases and frameworks.
