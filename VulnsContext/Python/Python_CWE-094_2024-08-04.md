# Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection') (CWE-094) in Python

###### Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection') Overview

**CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')** involves the injection of arbitrary code that is subsequently executed by the application. This vulnerability arises when:
- User-supplied data is not validated, filtered, or sanitized.
- Dynamic evaluation functions/processes such as `exec`, `eval`, or others are used with untrusted data.
- Templates are rendered without proper context awareness, leading to template injection.

Code injection can occur in multiple programming languages and frameworks, but here we will specifically consider how this vulnerability can arise in Python, along with examples that help in creating rules for a Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tool.

### Python-Specific Code Injection Examples

#### Direct `eval` and `exec` usage
The direct use of `eval()` and `exec()` with user-supplied inputs are classic examples of code injection vulnerabilities:
```python
user_input = "calc(2*3)"
result = eval(user_input)  # Vulnerable to code injection
```
Detect patterns where `eval` or `exec` are used with non-sanitized user input.

#### Usage in Web Frameworks

1. **Django**
Django applications might suffer from code injection if the template rendering process is misused with unsanitized data:
```python
from django.shortcuts import render

def my_view(request):
    template_name = request.GET.get('template')
    return render(request, template_name)  # Vulnerable if `template_name` is user-controlled
```
Rules should detect when Django's `render` function takes user-controlled input as the template name.

2. **Flask**
Flask applications can be vulnerable to code injection in routing and dynamic execution cases:
```python
from flask import Flask, request

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/exec')
def exec_code():
    code = request.args.get('code')
    exec(code)  # Vulnerable to code injection
    return "Code executed"
```
SAST rules should flag the use of `exec` and `eval` with Flask user inputs and detect directly in the route handlers.

3. **Jinja2 Template Injection**
Jinja2, a common templating engine used with Flask, can be vulnerable to server-side template injection:
```python
from flask import Flask, request
from jinja2 import Template

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/render_template')
def render_template():
    template_str = request.args.get('template')
    Template(template_str).render()  # Vulnerable to template injection
    return "Template rendered"
```
Identify instances of template rendering with unsanitized user inputs.

### Additional Python Injection Examples

#### Panda's `eval()` Method:
```python
import pandas as pd

user_input = "df['column'].sum()"
df.eval(user_input)  # Unsafe when `user_input` is not sanitized
```
Detect calls to pandas’ `eval` method with user-controlled input.

#### SQLAlchemy and Raw SQL
Using raw SQL with SQLAlchemy without proper sanitization can lead to SQL injection:
```python
from sqlalchemy import create_engine

engine = create_engine('sqlite:///:memory:')
user_input = "some untrusted input"

query = f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = '{user_input}'"  # Unsafe raw SQL
engine.execute(query)
```
Identify SQLAlchemy `execute` calls with formatted strings from user inputs.

### Effective SAST Rules

1. **Function Detection**
   - Flag usages of sensitive functions (`eval`, `exec`, `render`, `Template.render`) that take user-generated inputs.
2. **Data Flow Analysis**
   - Track data flows from untrusted sources (e.g., HTTP requests, forms, query params) to sensitive sinks (function calls).
3. **String Operations**
   - Alert for pattern matching of formatted strings particularly around SQL-like queries.
4. **Context Awareness**
   - Ensure context-awareness is employed, such as within web frameworks where template and SQL queries are utilized.

**Example Rule Implementation:**

```regex
(eval|exec|render)\(.*request\.\w+\(.*\)\)
```
This regex flags uses of `eval` or `exec` with user data directly from request parameters.

In conclusion, the key components of code injection detection in Python environments can be effectively built into a SAST tool by recognizing untrusted data flows into critical function calls, combined with thorough pattern matching and context analysis.
