# Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) (CWE-352) in Python

###### Understanding Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

**Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)** is a type of attack that tricks a user into executing unwanted actions on a web application in which they are authenticated. Due to this, the application cannot differentiate between valid user actions and actions initiated by a malicious entity.

In a typical CSRF attack:
1. The attacker crafts a malicious request.
2. The authenticated user inadvertently executes this request via their browser.
3. The web application performs the action, believing it to be a legitimate request from the user.

### Key Strategies to Mitigate CSRF

To combat CSRF, several strategies are commonly employed:
- **Built-in CSRF Protection**: Utilize framework-provided solutions.
- **Token-Based Mitigation**:
  - **Synchronizer Token Pattern**: CSRF tokens are uniquely generated and validated.
  - **Double Submit Cookies**: Verifying tokens sent both as cookies and as request parameters.
- **Custom Request Headers**: Employed for AJAX/API requests.
- **Defense in Depth**: Combine multiple security measures for better protection.
- **SameSite Cookie Attribute**: Applied to restrict how cookies are sent with cross-site requests.
- **User Interaction Verification**: Ensuring sensitive actions are confirmed by the user.

### CSRF in Python Frameworks

Let's look at how CSRF manifests and can be detected in some popular Python web frameworks like Django, Flask, and Pyramid. 

#### Django

**1. Usage without CSRF Tokens**

```python
# settings.py
# CSRF middleware might be disabled, making the app vulnerable to CSRF.
MIDDLEWARE = [
    # 'django.middleware.csrf.CsrfViewMiddleware',  # This is commented out
    ...
]

# views.py
from django.shortcuts import render

def my_view(request):
    # No CSRF token is being checked here
    if request.method == 'POST':
        # Perform some state-changing logic
        ...
```

**2. CSRF-Exempt Views**

```python
from django.views.decorators.csrf import csrf_exempt

@csrf_exempt
def unprotected_view(request):
    # Directly processes POST requests without CSRF validation
    if request.method == 'POST':
        ...
```

In Django, proper CSRF protection involves ensuring that the `CsrfViewMiddleware` is in place and views are not marked with `@csrf_exempt` unnecessarily.

#### Flask

**1. Lack of CSRF Protection**

```python
from flask import Flask, request

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/change-password', methods=['POST'])
def change_password():
    # No CSRF protection implemented
    new_password = request.form['new_password']
    # Perform password change
    ...
```

**2. Utilizing CSRF with Flask-WTF**

```python
from flask_wtf import CSRFProtect
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)
csrf = CSRFProtect(app)

@app.route('/submit', methods=['POST'])
def submit():
    # CSRF protected due to Flask-WTF integration
    ...

```

#### Pyramid

**1. Custom CSRF Token Validation**

```python
from pyramid.view import view_config
from pyramid.csrf import get_csrf_token

@view_config(route_name='secure_action', request_method='POST')
def secure_action(request):
    token = request.params.get('csrf_token')
    if not token or token != get_csrf_token(request):
        raise HTTPForbidden('CSRF token mismatch')
    ...

# Lack of such validation can be a vulnerability
```

### Writing SAST Rules

**Detection Criteria:**

1. **Django**:
   - Ensure `CsrfViewMiddleware` is included in `MIDDLEWARE`.
   - Identify views decorated with `@csrf_exempt`.

2. **Flask**:
   - Check if `CSRFProtect` is instantiated and applied.
   - Analyze routes handling POST requests without CSRF tokens.

3. **Pyramid**:
   - Examine if views performing state changes validate CSRF tokens using `get_csrf_token`.

False positives can be reduced by verifying that CSRF protection mechanisms are absent or disabled in critical path processes. False negatives can be minimized by also inspecting custom token validation implementations.

### Summary

CSRF is a severe yet preventable vulnerability. By understanding its variations across different frameworks and implementing appropriate detection measures, SAST tools can effectively flag instances of potential CSRF vulnerabilities. This knowledge is instrumental in crafting accurate detection rules within these tools, ensuring enhanced security postures for web applications.
