# Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following') (CWE-059) in Python

###### Understanding Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')

#### Definition
Improper Link Resolution Before File Access, commonly referred to as "Link Following," is encapsulated under CWE-59. This vulnerability occurs when a program improperly resolves file system links, such as symbolic or hard links, and subsequently accesses or modifies files in an unintended or unauthorized manner.

### Variations in Python

#### Explanation
In Python, this vulnerability can occur when file operations like reading, writing, or deleting are performed without proper validation on paths that may include symbolic links. This risk is often more pronounced in web frameworks or libraries that handle file uploads, data storage, and other file system interactions.

### Examples in Python

#### 1. Plain Python Script

##### Vulnerable Code
```python
import os

def read_file(file_path):
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        return file.read()

# A symbolic link created by an attacker pointing to '/etc/passwd'
print(read_file('/tmp/symlink_to_sensitive_file'))
```

##### Explanation
In the above script, if `file_path` is under the control of a user and is a symbolic link pointing to a sensitive file like `/etc/passwd`, the contents of this sensitive file could be read and exposed.

#### 2. Flask

##### Vulnerable Code
```python
from flask import Flask, request

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/read', methods=['GET'])
def read_file():
    file_path = request.args.get('file_path')
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        return file.read()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

##### Explanation
Here, `file_path` is taken directly from user input without validation. An attacker could provide a path to a symbolic link targeting any file the server has access to, exposing its contents.

#### 3. Django

##### Vulnerable Code
```python
from django.http import HttpResponse
import os

def read_file(request):
    file_path = request.GET.get('file_path')
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        data = file.read()
    return HttpResponse(data)
```

##### Explanation
Similar to the Flask example, Django processes a user-supplied `file_path` without verifying whether it is a symbolic link pointing to a sensitive file. It reads and exposes potentially sensitive data.

### Mitigation Techniques

#### Verify File Paths

##### Example
```python
import os

def read_file(file_path):
    if not os.path.islink(file_path):
        with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
            return file.read()
    else:
        raise ValueError("Symbolic links are not allowed")
```

#### Canonicalization of Paths

##### Example
```python
import os

def read_file(file_path):
    real_path = os.path.realpath(file_path)
    if real_path.startswith("/allowed_directory/"):
        with open(real_path, 'r') as file:
            return file.read()
    else:
        raise ValueError("Unauthorized file path")
```

### Writing SAST Rules

For SAST tools, here are some heuristic checks to detect improper link resolution:

1. **File Operation Detection**: Identify code where file operations (`open`, `os.remove`, `os.rename`, etc.) take place.
2. **User Input Sources**: Detect file paths that derive from user inputs (query parameters, form data, etc.).
3. **Symbolic Link Checks**: Ensure that symbolic link checks (`os.path.islink`) or realpath validation (`os.path.realpath`) are in place.
4. **Framework-Specific Patterns**: Incorporate specific checks for web frameworks (like Flask's `request.args.get` or Django's `request.GET.get`) to track user-provided file paths.

Implementing these rules should help in identifying potential CWE-59 issues with high accuracy and thereby reducing both false positives and false negatives.

By systematically checking every instance where user input influences file path resolution and ensuring proper validation is performed, SAST tools can greatly mitigate the risks associated with improper link resolution vulnerabilities.
