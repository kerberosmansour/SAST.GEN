# Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal') (CWE-022) in PHP

###### Understanding Path Traversal Vulnerability in PHP

**Definition**:
Path Traversal, also known as Directory Traversal, is a type of vulnerability where the attacker manipulates the input paths to access files and directories that are outside the intended directory. This can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive files, configuration files, or even a system takeover when critical system files are exposed.

In PHP applications, this often occurs when user input is directly used in file operations without adequate validation or sanitization.

### Variations and Exploitation Examples

#### Example 1: Basic Path Traversal
Here is a simple PHP example where a user-provided 'filename' is read without adequate validation, leading to potential Path Traversal:

```php
<?php
$filename = $_GET['filename'];
readfile('/var/www/html/files/' . $filename);
?>
```
**If a user accesses `http://example.com/script.php?filename=../../../../etc/passwd`, it could possibly read the server's password file.**

#### Example 2: Framework-based Example (Laravel)
In a Laravel-based application, consider the following code, which serves files based on user input:

```php
Route::get('/download', function(Request $request) {
    return response()->download(storage_path('content/') . $request->input('filename'));
});
```
**Without sanitizing the user input, a similar path traversal attack could expose sensitive files**.

#### Preventing Path Traversal

1. **Sanitize User Input Using `basename()`**:
   This function strips out directory information, thus preventing manipulation.

```php
Route::get('/download', function(Request $request) {
    return response()->download(storage_path('content/') . basename($request->input('filename')));
});
```

2. **Validate The File Path**:
   Use PHP's `realpath()` function to resolve the absolute path and ensure it resides within the intended directory.

```php
<?php
$filename = $_GET['filename'];
$path = realpath('/var/www/html/files/' . $filename);
if (strpos($path, '/var/www/html/files/') !== 0) {
    die("Access denied!");
}
readfile($path);
?>
```

### Writing SAST Rules for Detecting Path Traversal in PHP

When creating Static Application Security Testing (SAST) rules to detect Path Traversal vulnerabilities in PHP, consider the following:

**Key Elements to Identify**:
1. **User Input Functions**: `$_GET`, `$_POST`, `$_REQUEST`, `$_COOKIE`.
2. **File Access Functions**: `readfile()`, `file_get_contents()`, `include`, `require`, `require_once`, `include_once`, `fopen()`, etc.
3. **Common Patterns**: Concatenation of user input with file paths.

**Example SAST Rule (Pseudo-Code)**:
```plaintext
rule pathTraversal_vulnerability
where:
  function in (file_access_functions) and
  input_source in (user_input_functions) and
  input is concatenated with a file path without sanitization functions (basename and realpath)
```

### Reducing False Positives and False Negatives

- **False Positives**: These occur when code is flagged as vulnerable, but proper sanitization has been applied. To avoid this, ensure your SAST rules check for the presence of `basename`, and `realpath`.
  
- **False Negatives**: These occur when actual vulnerabilities go undetected. To mitigate this, thoroughly consider various ways user input can be provided and concatenated with paths. Moreover, account for different frameworks and libraries which may use unique input handling patterns.

### Common Pitfalls and Edge Cases

1. **Complex Paths with Symbolic Links**: Ensure your SAST understands the implications of symbolic links which might bypass straightforward path checks.
2. **Dynamic Path Construction**: Dynamically building paths at various stages with different user inputs might evade simple concatenation checks.
3. **Framework-specific Functions**: Some frameworks might have their own methods, which aren't direct PHP file access methods but eventually lead to file access. SAST rules should be aware of these methods.

By leveraging the example codes and detection rules provided, security engineers can build robust SAST rules that accurately and effectively detect Path Traversal vulnerabilities in PHP applications, ensuring minimal false positives and negatives.
