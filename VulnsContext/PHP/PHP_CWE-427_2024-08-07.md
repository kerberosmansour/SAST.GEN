# Uncontrolled Search Path Element (CWE-427) in PHP

###### Understanding Uncontrolled Search Path Element in PHP

The Uncontrolled Search Path Element vulnerability (CWE-426) occurs when an application searches for and loads a component (e.g., a library or executable) that is specified by an externally controlled input and does not properly validate the input before using it. In PHP, this type of vulnerability often appears in scenarios where user-controlled data is used to influence include or require statements or when modifying the PHP include path.

### Variations of Uncontrolled Search Path Element in PHP

#### 1. Improper Use of `include` or `require`
One classic manifestation of this vulnerability is when a web application allows user-supplied input to determine the file to be included or required.

**Example:**
```php
<?php
$page = $_GET['page'];
include($page . '.php'); // Vulnerable to path traversal
?>
```
In this example, an attacker can manipulate the `page` parameter to include arbitrary files from the server, such as `../../etc/passwd`.

#### 2. Manipulating the Include Path
Another variation is allowing user-controlled data to manipulate the include path via `ini_set`.

**Example:**
```php
<?php
$custom_path = $_GET['path'];
ini_set('include_path', $custom_path);
require('library.php'); // Unsafe include path
?>
```
An attacker can set the `path` parameter to a directory that contains malicious files.

### Code Examples and Contexts for PHP Frameworks

#### Using in Different Contexts

**Example in a Framework (e.g., Laravel):**
Even though modern frameworks like Laravel have built-in protections, misuse can still lead to vulnerabilities.

```php
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Route;

Route::get('/profile/{file}', function ($file) {
    include(base_path('profiles/' . $file));
});
```
If `$file` is not properly sanitized, an attacker can traverse directories and include arbitrary files.

### Guide to Writing SAST Rules for Uncontrolled Search Path Element

#### Key Aspects to Consider

1. **Identify Sources**: Recognize user inputs that influence file paths, e.g., `$_GET`, `$_POST`, and other user-controlled variables.
2. **Identify Sinks**: Look for functions that accept a path or filename and can load arbitrary files, such as `include()`, `require()`, `include_once()`, `require_once()`, `fopen()`, and similar functions.
3. **Path Manipulations**: Look for ways an application may change the include path using `ini_set` or other methods.
4. **Validation/Filtering**: Check if there is any filtering or validation done on the user input before it is used in path-based functions.

#### Example of SAST Rule Pseudocode

```pseudocode
rule UncontrolledSearchPathPHP
{
    strings:
        $sources = { "GET", "POST", "REQUEST", "Cookie", "Session", "_GET", "_POST", "_REQUEST", "_COOKIE", "_SESSION" }
        $sinks = { "include", "require", "include_once", "require_once", "fopen", "ini_set" }

    condition:
        any_of($sources) and any_of($sinks) and not validated_input
    
    additional_checks:
        ensure validation with functions such as basename(), realpath(), regex filtering that restricts "../../../"
}
```

### Minimizing False Positives and False Negatives

- **False Negatives**: Ensure to look at complex patterns. For instance, user inputs that are manipulated through additional functions or variables before being passed.
- **False Positives**: Confirm that proper validation (like `realpath()` and `basename()`) has not occurred before the sink function is invoked.

#### Common Pitfalls and Edge Cases

- **Indirect Inclusion**: If a chain of functions leads to the unsafe `include` or `require`, the detection logic should trace back through function calls.
- **Escape Sequences**: Ensure your rule can identify input sanitized yet later overridden by untrusted input again.
- **Framework-Specific Implementations**: Many frameworks have their mechanism of handling views and includes. Understand the framework specifics before deriving a rule set.

#### Input Validation for Avoiding Vulnerability

Between the source (user input) and sink (file inclusion), standard validation routines should involve:
- **Directory Restriction**: Restrict paths to known directories.
- **Extension Limitation**: Allow only certain types of files to be included.
- **Real Path Resolution**: Make sure to resolve the final path using `realpath()` to avoid directory traversal attacks and verify it resides within a specified directory.

**Example of Proper Validation in PHP:**
```php
<?php
$page = $_GET['page'];
$allowed_pages = ['home', 'about', 'contact'];

if (in_array($page, $allowed_pages)) {
    include($page . '.php');
} else {
    // handle the error
}
?>
```

By considering the examples and patterns provided, SAST tool authors can define rules to detect uncontrolled search path elements in PHP, ensuring robust security checks minimizing both false positives and false negatives【4:0†source】.
