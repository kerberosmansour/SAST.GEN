# Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following') (CWE-059) in PHP

###### Understanding Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')

Improper Link Resolution, or 'Link Following', is a vulnerability where an application incorrectly resolves symbolic links, leading to unauthorized access or modification of files. In PHP, symbolic links can be exploited if the code manipulating files does not properly validate paths before file access operations.

### Variations in PHP

Improper link resolution can manifest in various PHP contexts. For example:

1. **Direct File Access**:
   ```php
   // Directly accessing files without validation.
   $file = $_GET['file'];
   readfile($file);
   ```
   If the `$file` variable points to a symbolic link, an attacker can manipulate it to access unintended files.

2. **File/Directory Traversal**:
   ```php
   // Improper directory traversal can lead to link following.
   $filename = $_GET['filename'];
   if (file_exists("/var/www/uploads/" . $filename)) {
       include("/var/www/uploads/" . $filename);
   }
   ```
   Here, improper checks can allow an attacker to traverse directories using symbolic links.

3. **Framework-specific Variations**:
   - **Laravel**:
     Often, file operations like storage and retrieval are abstracted but still vulnerable if paths are not sanitized properly.
     ```php
     // Laravel storage example.
     $path = $request->input('path');
     return Storage::get($path);
     ```
     Without proper validation, `$path` could point to a symbolic link.

   - **CodeIgniter**:
     ```php
     // Handling file upload without comprehensive validation.
     $file_path = $this->input->post('file_path');
     $this->load->helper('file');
     $file_data = read_file($file_path);
     ```
     If `$file_path` is not thoroughly validated, it may follow a symbolic link.

### Examples of Improper Link Resolution

Improper link resolution often arises from inadequate validation of file paths. Below are examples illustrating variations in PHP.

**Example 1: Basic Vulnerability**
```php
$target = 'uploads/' . $_GET['file'];
if (file_exists($target)) {
    echo file_get_contents($target);
}
```
An attacker could set `file` parameter to a symlink pointing to sensitive files like `/etc/passwd`.

**Example 2: Using `realpath` Incorrectly**
```php
$target = $_GET['file'];
$base_dir = '/var/www/uploads/';
$full_path = realpath($base_dir . $target);

if (substr($full_path, 0, strlen($base_dir)) === $base_dir) {
    include($full_path);
}
```
`realpath` can resolve symlinks, but if not carefully checked, it can still be exploited. This defense could still fail due to race conditions or inherent flaws in symbolic links handling.

### Guidance for Writing SAST Rules

**1. Identify Entry Points:**
   - Scan for functions taking filename/path inputs from user input like `$_GET`, `$_POST`, `$request->input()`.
   - Common functions include `file_exists`, `readfile`, `fopen`, `include`, `require`, and framework-specific storage handlers.

**2. Validate Inputs:**
   - Ensure paths are canonicalized using `realpath`, but further checks must verify against directory traversal and symbolic links.
   - Example detection rule might look for:
     ```regex
     (include|require|readfile|file_get_contents|fopen|Storage::get)\(\$.*(\$_GET|\$_POST|\$request->input)
     ```

**3. Verify Safe Base Directories:**
   - Ensure resolved paths stay within intended bounds.
   - Example detection rule for safe directories:
     ```regex
     (include|require|readfile|file_get_contents|fopen)\(.*(realpath\(.*\) ==|strncmp\(.*base_dir.*\))
     ```

**4. Detect Common Pitfalls:**
   - **Race Conditions:** Symbolic link targets can change between validation and access.
   - **Non-canonical Paths:** Avoid reliance solely on `realpath`; consider additional validations for dangerous paths (`/../`, `/./`).

### Examples of Defensive Coding

**Example 1: Path Validation**
```php
$target = $_GET['file'];
$base_dir = '/var/www/uploads/';
$full_path = realpath($base_dir . $target);

if ($full_path && strpos($full_path, realpath($base_dir)) === 0) {
    include($full_path);
}
```

**Example 2: Framework Usage with Extra Checks**
```php
// Laravel example
$path = $request->input('path');
$base_dir = storage_path('app/public/');
$full_path = realpath($base_dir . $path);

if ($full_path && strpos($full_path, $base_dir) === 0) {
    return Storage::get($full_path);
}
```

### Conclusion

Creating accurate SAST rules for detecting improper link resolution requires understanding how PHP handles file paths and utilizing robust path validation. By detecting common insecure coding patterns and focusing on properly canonicalizing and validating file paths, false positives and negatives can be minimized, enhancing the reliability of security analysis.
