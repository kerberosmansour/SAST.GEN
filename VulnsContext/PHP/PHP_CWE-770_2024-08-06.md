# Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling (CWE-770) in PHP

###### Understanding Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling in PHP

Allocation of resources without limits or throttling can lead to denial of service (DoS) vulnerabilities by allowing excessive resource consumption. In PHP applications, this might manifest as unbounded memory allocation, CPU usage, file uploads, and database queries. If these resources are not properly managed, it can lead to application slowdowns or crashes.

### Variations of Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling in PHP

#### 1. File Uploads
When users can upload files without any size limits, the server's storage might get exhausted.

**Example:**
```php
if(isset($_FILES['upload'])){
    move_uploaded_file($_FILES['upload']['tmp_name'], 'uploads/' . $_FILES['upload']['name']);
}
```
*Issue:* No checks on file size or type.

**Fix:**
```php
$maxFileSize = 2 * 1024 * 1024; // 2 MB
if(isset($_FILES['upload']) && $_FILES['upload']['size'] <= $maxFileSize){
    move_uploaded_file($_FILES['upload']['tmp_name'], 'uploads/' . $_FILES['upload']['name']);
}
```

#### 2. Database Queries
Allowing queries that can retrieve or modify large amounts of data can lead to high memory usage and CPU load.

**Example:**
```php
$query = "SELECT * FROM users";
$result = mysqli_query($conn, $query);
while($row = mysqli_fetch_assoc($result)){
    echo $row['name'];
}
```
*Issue:* No limits on the amount of data retrieved.

**Fix:**
```php
$limit = 100;
$query = "SELECT * FROM users LIMIT $limit";
$result = mysqli_query($conn, $query);
while($row = mysqli_fetch_assoc($result)){
    echo $row['name'];
}
```

#### 3. Unrestricted Loops
Loops that process user input can cause excessive CPU usage.

**Example:**
```php
for($i = 0; $i < $_GET['iterations']; $i++){
    // Some resource intensive operation
}
```
*Issue:* User can control the number of iterations.

**Fix:**
```php
$maxIterations = 1000;
$iterations = min($_GET['iterations'], $maxIterations);
for($i = 0; $i < $iterations; $i++){
    // Some resource intensive operation
}
```

### Guidance for Writing SAST Rules

#### Identify Patterns

When writing SAST rules, it's essential to identify common patterns that lead to resource allocation issues:

1. **File Uploads**
   - Look for `move_uploaded_file` without accompanying checks for file size.
   
2. **Database Queries**
   - Identify `SELECT` statements without `LIMIT`.

3. **Loops**
   - Detect for-loops where the control variable is influenced by user input without an upper bound.

#### Example SAST Rule (Pseudo-code)

```python
# Pseudo-code for detecting unchecked file uploads
for file_upload in ast.find_all('move_uploaded_file'):
    if not file_upload.has_size_check():
        report_issue('Unchecked file upload detected', file_upload.location)
```

### Minimizing False Positives and False Negatives

1. **Context Awareness**: Ensure your rules take the context into account. For example, identify the presence of size checks or limits within the same function scope where the resource allocation occurs.
2. **Tuning for Specific Frameworks**: Different PHP frameworks have their own ways of handling resources. Tailor your SAST rules to recognize framework-specific patterns.
3. **Test and Iterate**: Continuously test your rules against known vulnerable and non-vulnerable codebases to refine their accuracy.

### Conclusion

Writing accurate SAST rules requires an understanding of how resource allocation vulnerabilities manifest in PHP applications. By providing thorough checks and considering different coding patterns and frameworks, SAST rules can effectively identify and prevent allocation of resources without limits or throttling.
