# Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information (CWE-319) in PHP

###### Understanding Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information
Cleartext transmission of sensitive information occurs when data such as passwords, personal identifiers, or financial information is transmitted over a network in a readable format without encryption. This exposes the data to interception and misuse by unauthorized entities. In PHP applications, this can manifest in various ways, including using insecure transport protocols or improperly handling sensitive data.

### Variations in PHP Applications
In PHP, cleartext transmission vulnerabilities can take several forms, especially when dealing with popular frameworks like Laravel, Symfony, or CodeIgniter. Here are some examples and variations:

1. **Using HTTP Instead of HTTPS**:
   Sending sensitive information over HTTP instead of HTTPS leaves it exposed to anyone intercepting the traffic.
   ```php
   // Vulnerable to cleartext transmission
   $ch = curl_init();
   curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_URL, "http://example.com/api/login");
   curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POST, 1);
   curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS, "username=user&password=pass");
   curl_exec($ch);
   curl_close($ch);
   ```

2. **Sending Sensitive Data Without Encryption**:
   Directly sending sensitive data without encryption can lead to exposure.
   ```php
   // Example using POST method without encryption
   $username = $_POST['username'];
   $password = $_POST['password'];
   // Transmitting sensitive data in cleartext
   $ch = curl_init('http://example.com/api/submit');
   curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POST, 1);
   curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS, "username=$username&password=$password");
   curl_exec($ch);
   curl_close($ch);
   ```

3. **SMTP Without Secure Protocols**:
   Sending emails containing sensitive information using SMTP without TLS or other secure protocols.
   ```php
   // Sending email without encryption
   $to = 'example@example.com';
   $subject = 'Sensitive Information';
   $message = 'Here is your password: secret';
   $headers = 'From: webmaster@example.com' . "\r\n" .
              'Reply-To: webmaster@example.com' . "\r\n" .
              'X-Mailer: PHP/' . phpversion();
   mail($to, $subject, $message, $headers);
   ```

### Creating Effective SAST Rules
To write precise and effective Static Application Security Testing (SAST) rules for detecting cleartext transmission of sensitive information in PHP, consider the following steps:

#### Understanding the Vulnerability
1. **Identify Sensitive Data**:
   - Username, password, personal identifiers.
   - Financial information such as credit card details.
2. **Identify Insecure Transport Methods**:
   - HTTP instead of HTTPS.
   - Insecure email protocols like SMTP without TLS.

#### Rule Examples with Explanations
1. **Detect Cleartext Transmission via HTTP**:
   - Rule: Look for `curl_setopt` with `CURLOPT_URL` containing `http://` and the presence of sensitive data in `CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS`.
   - PHP Example:
     ```php
     $ch = curl_init();
     curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_URL, "http://example.com/api/login");
     curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POST, 1);
     curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS, "username=user&password=pass");
     curl_exec($ch);
     curl_close($ch);
     ```

2. **Detecting Unencrypted Email Transmission**:
   - Rule: Look for functions such as `mail()` and ensure no secure protocols like `smpt_secure` are set.
   - PHP Example:
     ```php
     $to = 'example@example.com';
     $subject = 'Sensitive Information';
     $message = 'Here is your password: secret';
     $headers = 'From: webmaster@example.com';
     mail($to, $subject, $message, $headers);
     ```

#### Minimizing False Positives and Negatives
1. **Contextual Analysis**:
   - Ensure the SAST tool considers the context in which sensitive data is transmitted. For example, data sent within a local development environment may not need the same scrutiny as data sent over public networks.
2. **Pattern Matching and Heuristics**:
   - Use advanced pattern matching to detect complex usage patterns.
   - Implement heuristics to determine the likelihood of sensitive data being involved, considering variable names, and function parameters.
3. **Framework-Specific Rules**:
   - Implement rules that are tailored to popular frameworks and their conventions. For example, analyze Laravel's `Mail` facade to check for secure email settings.

```php
// Laravel example with improper configuration
Mail::raw('Sensitive data', function ($message) {
    $message->to('example@example.com')
            ->subject('Subject');
});
```

### Conclusion
Writing effective SAST rules for detecting cleartext transmission of sensitive information in PHP requires a good understanding of how sensitive data can be transmitted insecurely, awareness of common pitfalls in different PHP frameworks, and careful crafting of rules that can accurately identify vulnerabilities without causing too many false positives or negatives. Using the provided examples and detailed explanations should help guide you in creating robust SAST rules to improve your application's security posture .
