# Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type (CWE-434) in PHP

###### Understanding Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type in PHP

**Unrestricted File Upload** vulnerabilities occur when an application allows users to upload files without sufficient validation and filtering. These files may include dangerous types which may lead to code execution, system takeover, or manipulation of data.

### Variations and Examples

1. **Basic Example**:
   ```php
   <?php
   if(isset($_FILES['upload'])){
       move_uploaded_file($_FILES['upload']['tmp_name'], "uploads/" . $_FILES['upload']['name']);
   }
   ?>
   ```
   Here, there's no validation against the uploaded file type, allowing potentially harmful files to be uploaded and executed.

2. **MIME Type Check (Weak Validation)**:
   ```php
   <?php
   $allowedTypes = ['image/jpeg', 'image/png'];
   if(isset($_FILES['upload']) && in_array($_FILES['upload']['type'], $allowedTypes)){
       move_uploaded_file($_FILES['upload']['tmp_name'], "uploads/" . $_FILES['upload']['name']);
   }
   ?>
   ```
   This method checks the MIME type, but this can easily be spoofed.

3. **Extension Check (Weak Validation)**:
   ```php
   <?php
   $allowedExtensions = ['jpg', 'jpeg', 'png'];
   $fileExtension = pathinfo($_FILES['upload']['name'], PATHINFO_EXTENSION);
   if(isset($_FILES['upload']) && in_array($fileExtension, $allowedExtensions)){
       move_uploaded_file($_FILES['upload']['tmp_name'], "uploads/" . $_FILES['upload']['name']);
   }
   ?>
   ```
   Checking extensions can prevent some attacks but is still easily bypassed by renaming files.

4. **Content-based Validation (Strong Validation)**:
   ```php
   <?php
   $allowedTypes = ['image/jpeg', 'image/png'];
   if(isset($_FILES['upload']) && in_array(mime_content_type($_FILES['upload']['tmp_name']), $allowedTypes)){
       move_uploaded_file($_FILES['upload']['tmp_name'], "uploads/" . $_FILES['upload']['name']);
   }
   ?>
   ```
   Validating the actual content of the file (using `mime_content_type`) ensures that the file is indeed of the expected type, though it adds computational overhead.

### SAST Rule Creation

**Objective Elements**:

1. **File Upload Detection**:
   - Identify functions like `move_uploaded_file`, `copy`, `file_put_contents`, or `rename`.
  
   ```regex
   /(move_uploaded_file|copy|file_put_contents|rename)\s*\(/
   ```

2. **Validation Detection**:
   - Identify common input validation checks, especially for file uploads.
  
   ```regex
   /(mime_content_type|pathinfo|in_array)\s*\(/
   ```

3. **Validation Combination**:
   - Ensure checks for both file type and extension combined with source and destination tracking.
  
   ```php
   <?php
   $allowedTypes = ['image/jpeg', 'image/png'];
   if(isset($_FILES['upload'])){
       $fileType = mime_content_type($_FILES['upload']['tmp_name']);
       $fileExtension = pathinfo($_FILES['upload']['name'], PATHINFO_EXTENSION);
       if(in_array($fileType, $allowedTypes) && in_array($fileExtension, ['jpg', 'jpeg', 'png'])){
           move_uploaded_file($_FILES['upload']['tmp_name'], "uploads/" . $_FILES['upload']['name']);
       }
   }
   ?>
   ```

### Reducing False Positives/Negatives

1. **Comprehensive MIME Type Checks**:
   - Ensure multiple fail-safes (content and type checks).
   - Verify both MIME types and extensions because spoofing a single layer is easier.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - Check for common bypasses like incomplete validation, e.g., only checking the extension or MIME type but not both.
   - Scan for custom validation functions which might not adhere to proper validation practices.

3. **Common Input Validation Routines**:
   - Ensure the inclusion of `mime_content_type` for high assurance and robust validation.
   - Validate against enumeration of the file types allowed both by extension and MIME type.

### Example Detection Rule Logic:

```yaml
- id: php-file-upload-unrestricted
  message: "Unrestricted file upload detected. Ensure proper validation."
  languages: [php]
  severity: HIGH
  pattern-either:
    - pattern: (
        (move_uploaded_file|copy|file_put_contents|rename)
      )
    - pattern-not: (
        mime_content_type|pathinfo|in_array
      )
  metadata:
    cwe: "CWE-434"
    source: "local"
    description: "Detects cases where files are uploaded without thorough validation of file type or content."
```

### Common Validation Pitfalls

1. **Client-Side Validation**:
   - Don't rely entirely on client-side validation such as JavaScript validators as they can be bypassed.

2. **Allowing Too Many Extensions**:
   - Avoid using broad allow-lists. Instead, narrowly define acceptable file types.

3. **Dynamic Paths without Validation**:
   - Ensure that the destination path for the uploaded file is checked for traversal or similar vulnerabilities.

**Conclusion**:

By accurately identifying the essential components of potential vulnerability while combining thorough validation mechanisms, SAST rules can minimize both false positives and negatives, ensuring robust application security against unrestricted upload of dangerous file types.
