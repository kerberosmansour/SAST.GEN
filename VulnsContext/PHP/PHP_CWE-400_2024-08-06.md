# Uncontrolled Resource Consumption (CWE-400) in PHP

###### Understanding Uncontrolled Resource Consumption

Uncontrolled Resource Consumption, also known as Denial of Service (DoS) due to resource exhaustion, occurs when an application does not properly limit the amount of resources (e.g., CPU, memory, disk space, or network bandwidth) that can be consumed by a single user or request. In PHP applications, resource-intensive operations like file uploads, database queries, or memory allocations can be exploited to cause this vulnerability.

### Variations and Examples in PHP

#### Large File Uploads
One common variation is allowing users to upload excessively large files without proper limits. This could exhaust disk space or memory.

```php
if(isset($_FILES['file'])) {
    $file = $_FILES['file'];
    $destination = '/uploads/' . $file['name'];
    move_uploaded_file($file['tmp_name'], $destination);
}
```

**Mitigation Example:**

Add file size limits and handle errors appropriately:

```php
$maxFileSize = 2 * 1024 * 1024; // 2 MB
if (isset($_FILES['file']) && $_FILES['file']['size'] <= $maxFileSize) {
    $file = $_FILES['file'];
    $destination = '/uploads/' . $file['name'];
    move_uploaded_file($file['tmp_name'], $destination);
} else {
    echo "File is too large.";
}
```

#### Unrestricted Database Queries
Another example is executing expensive database queries without limits, leading to prolonged heavy database load.

```php
$userId = $_GET['user_id'];
$result = $db->query("SELECT * FROM records WHERE user_id = $userId");
while ($row = $result->fetch_assoc()) {
    // Process each row
}
```

**Mitigation Example:**

Limit the number of records returned by the query:

```php
$userId = $_GET['user_id'];
$result = $db->query("SELECT * FROM records WHERE user_id = $userId LIMIT 100");
while ($row = $result->fetch_assoc()) {
    // Process each row
}
```

### Guidance for Writing SAST Rules

#### Rule Creation Considerations

To effectively write SAST rules to detect Uncontrolled Resource Consumption in PHP, consider the following steps:

1. **Identify Resource Intensive Functions:**
   - Look for functions dealing with file handling, large loops, memory allocation, or extensive database interactions.

2. **Parameter Validation:**
   - Ensure functions that accept user input are validated for size and type.

3. **Depth and Breadth Analysis:**
   - Analyze the call stack to ensure nested functions also validate their inputs.

#### Code Examples for Detection

1. **File Upload Size Check:**

```php
if ($_FILES['file']['size'] > 2000000) { // Check if file size exceeds 2MB
    // Handle error
}
```

- Look for the `_FILES` superglobal and conditional checks on its size attribute.

2. **Limiting Query Results:**

```php
$query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE status = 'active' LIMIT 100"; // Ensure LIMIT is present
$result = $db->query($query);
```

- Detect SQL queries without a `LIMIT` clause inside functions handling requests.

#### Reducing False Positives and Negatives

1. **Context-Aware Analysis:**
   - Implement context-based checks to understand when a resource-intensive function is within a safe usage context.
  
2. **Function Pattern Recognition:**
   - Use patterns to recognize common mistakes and correct usage of resource limits in different frameworks.

#### Common Pitfalls and Edge Cases

1. **Framework-specific Implementations:**
   - Different PHP frameworks (Laravel, Symfony) might have their methods for handling files or queries.

Example for Laravel (Eloquent):

```php
$users = User::where('status', 'active')->take(100)->get(); // Proper use of LIMIT
```

2. **Indirect Resource Consumption:**
   - Functions indirectly leading to resource consumption, such as calling a function that recursively processes data.

### Conclusion

By focusing on how uncontrolled resource consumption manifests in PHP and providing concrete examples and methods to detect and mitigate such vulnerabilities, SAST rules can be effectively designed to minimize both false positives and false negatives【4:1†source】【4:2†source】【4:3†source】【4:4†source】【4:5†source】.
