# Access of Resource Using Incompatible Type ('Type Confusion') (CWE-843) in PHP

#### Understanding Access of Resource Using Incompatible Type ('Type Confusion') in PHP

### Overview

Access of Resource Using Incompatible Type, commonly referred to as 'Type Confusion', occurs when an application processes data (or data types) in an unexpected format. This can lead to various security vulnerabilities, including unauthorized access, data corruption, and crashes. In PHP, type confusion can manifest through improperly validated input types, misuse of dynamic typing, or incorrect parameter use.

### Variations of Type Confusion in PHP

#### Example 1: Manual Type Conversion
PHP is a dynamically typed language, meaning variables do not have a fixed type. This flexibility can cause type confusion if assumptions about variable types are incorrect. For example:
```php
$input = $_GET['user_id']; // User-provided input
if ($input == 12345) {
    echo "Admin user detected.";
} else {
    echo "Standard user.";
}
```
In this code snippet, `$_GET['user_id']` is treated as a string but compared with an integer without explicit type casting. An attacker can exploit this by providing an input that bypasses the check.

#### Example 2: Function Parameter Type Mismatch
Another form of type confusion arises from incorrect assumptions about function input types:
```php
function isAdult($age) {
    return $age >= 18;
}

$user_age = $_POST['age']; // User-provided input
if (isAdult($user_age)) {
    echo "Welcome!";
} else {
    echo "Too young.";
}
```
In this example, `$_POST['age']` is likely to be a string, which can lead to unexpected behavior or bypassing logic checks if not properly validated.

### Framework-Specific Example: Laravel
Laravel, a popular PHP framework, relies heavily on its ORM (Eloquent) for database operations. Here, type confusion can occur when dealing with user input:
```php
$user = User::where('id', '=', $request->input('user_id'))->first();
if ($user) {
    // Perform operations
}
```
If `user_id` is not strictly validated, it could lead to SQL injection or fetching unintended records.

## Writing SAST Rules to Detect Type Confusion

### Key Detection Strategies

1. **Inspect Type Usage:** Review areas where variables are dynamically typed or cast without validation.
2. **Check Function Parameters:** Ensure functions receive the expected data types.
3. **Validate External Input:** Confirm that all user-provided inputs are appropriately sanitized and cast to expected types.

### Example SAST Rule for PHP

#### Detecting Insecure Type Comparisons

This SAST rule focuses on identifying insecure type comparisons, which can lead to type confusion vulnerabilities.

**Pattern:**
```regex
if\s*\(\s*\$[a-zA-Z0-9_]+\s*==\s*[0-9]+\s*\)
```

This regex looks for `if` statements where variables are compared directly to integers using `==`.

**Sample Code to Match:**
```php
if ($input == 12345) {
```

**SAST Rule Example Implementation:**
```yaml
- id: php-type-confusion-insecure-comparison
  pattern: if (${{VAR}} == ${{CONST}})
  message: "Insecure type comparison detected. Use strict comparison '===' to avoid type confusion."
  severity: WARNING
  languages: [php]
```

### Common Pitfalls in Detection Rules

1. **Overlooking Dynamic Typing:** PHP's dynamic typing can make it challenging to ascertain variable types accurately. Implement type-checking functions and enforce strict comparisons.
2. **Complex User Inputs:** Inputs from web forms or APIs can introduce complex types that need thorough validation and sanitization.
3. **Framework Interaction:** Ensure the detection rules cover common usage patterns specific to frameworks like Laravel, Symfony, etc.

### Recommendations for SAST Rule Authors

1. **Reduce False Positives:** Refine patterns to ensure rules do not flag legitimate uses of dynamic typing.
2. **Comprehensive Testing:** Test SAST rules against a variety of real-world codebases to ensure accuracy.
3. **Incremental Improvements:** Iteratively update rules based on new patterns and feedback from security reviews.

By implementing these strategies, SAST tools can more effectively detect 'Type Confusion' vulnerabilities in PHP, helping developers maintain secure codebases.
