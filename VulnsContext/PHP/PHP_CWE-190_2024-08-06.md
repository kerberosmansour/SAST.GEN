# Integer Overflow or Wraparound (CWE-190) in PHP

###### Understanding Integer Overflow or Wraparound in PHP

**Integer Overflow or Wraparound in PHP**

Integer overflow happens when an arithmetic operation attempts to create a numeric value that exceeds the maximum limit the data type can store. In PHP, integers are typically limited by the architecture: an `int` is a signed 64-bit value on a 64-bit machine, giving a range of approximately `-9,223,372,036,854,775,808` to `9,223,372,036,854,775,807`.

PHP lacks explicit features to prevent overflows. Instead, it changes the datatype automatically if the value is too large, switching from integers to floating-point numbers silently.

**Example 1: Basic Overflow**

```php
$largeValue = PHP_INT_MAX;
$result = $largeValue + 1;
echo $result; // This would output a float value instead of an integer
```

**Example 2: Unintended Wraparound**

A wraparound can occur if negative numbers wrap around to positive numbers due to underflow.

```php
$smallValue = -PHP_INT_MAX - 1;
$result = $smallValue - 1;
echo $result; // Converts to positive number unexpectedly
```

### Detecting Integer Overflow in PHP through SAST

**Key Concepts:**

1. **Type Coercion:** PHP implicitly converts large integers to floats, making overflow checks crucial.
2. **Boundary Checks:** Implementing boundary conditions to ensure arithmetic operations stay within the desired range.

**Guidance on Writing SAST Rules**

**1. Identify Vulnerability Patterns**

A SAST tool should identify common arithmetic operations that may result in integer overflow. Typical operations include:
- Addition (`$a + $b`)
- Subtraction (`$a - $b`)
- Multiplication (`$a * $b`)
- Division (`$a / $b`)

**Example Patterns to Detect**

**Addition and Subtraction Pattern:**

Detect and analyze the context where addition or subtraction operations are performed around boundary values:

```php
if ($a > PHP_INT_MAX - $b) {
    // Potential overflow
}
$result = $a + $b;
```

**Multiplication Pattern:**

```php
if ($a > PHP_INT_MAX / $b) {
    // Potential overflow
}
$result = $a * $b;
```

**Sample PHP Code Checking for Potential Overflow:**

```php
// Addition check
if ($a > 0 && $b > 0 && $a + $b < 0) {
    // Overflow occurred
} elseif ($a < 0 && $b < 0 && $a + $b > 0) {
    // Underflow occurred
}

// Subtraction check
if ($a > 0 && $b < 0 && $a - $b < 0) {
    // Overflow occurred
} elseif ($a < 0 && $b > 0 && $a - $b > 0) {
    // Underflow occurred
}

// Multiplication check
if ($a > 0 && $b > 0 && $a * $b < 0) {
    // Overflow occurred
} elseif ($a < 0 && $b < 0 && $a * $b < 0) {
    // Overflow occurred
} elseif ($a > 0 && $b < 0 && $a * $b > 0) {
    // Underflow occurred
} elseif ($a < 0 && $b > 0 && $a * $b > 0) {
    // Underflow occurred
}
```

**2. Minimize False Positives and False Negatives**

**False Positives:** These occur when the SAST tool flags code that isn't genuinely vulnerable. 
- Ensure the SAST rule checks boundary conditions strictly without assuming all large value operations are dangerous.
  
**False Negatives:** These are missed detections of real vulnerabilities.
- Writing comprehensive rules that cover all arithmetic operations and potential data paths ensures credible coverage.

**3. Edge Cases and Common Pitfalls**

Consider potential edge cases such as:
- Operations involving both positive and negative numbers.
- Mixed integer and floating-point operations.
- Implicit type conversions, like from strings when dealing with input values.

**Example Edge Case:**

```php
$value = "9223372036854775807"; // A string representing a large integer
$intValue = (int) $value;
echo $intValue + 1; // Unexpected float conversion if not handled properly
```

**4. Integrating Rules in SAST**

**Rule Creation:**

- **Pattern Matching:** Use abstract syntax trees (AST) to identify potential operations leading to overflow.
- **Boundary Analysis:** Apply threshold checks relative to `PHP_INT_MAX` and `PHP_INT_MIN`.

**Sample SAST Rule (Pseudocode):**

```pseudo
rule integerOverflowCheck
  when functionCall(addOperation | subtractOperation | multiplyOperation)
  then
    if argument1 > PHP_INT_MAX - argument2 {
      report "Possible integer overflow detected."
    }
end
```

### Conclusion

Creating an effective SAST rule for detecting integer overflow or wraparound in PHP involves understanding both the underlying arithmetic operations and PHP's type conversion mechanisms. Comprehensive rule design, boundary checking, and careful handling of edge cases help in minimizing false positives and negatives, leading to robust detection.
