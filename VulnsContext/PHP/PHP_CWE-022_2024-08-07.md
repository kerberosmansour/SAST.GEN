# Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal') (CWE-022) in PHP

#### Understanding Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal') in PHP

### 1. **Overview of Path Traversal**

Path traversal vulnerabilities allow an attacker to access directories and files stored outside the intended directory. This is possible by using special character sequences, typically "../", to navigate up the directory tree. In PHP, such vulnerabilities often arise when application input is directly used in file operations without proper validation.

### 2. **Variations in Path Traversal in PHP**

PHP is a versatile scripting language, and path traversal vulnerabilities can appear in numerous ways, including:

- **Direct File Inclusion:**
  ```php
  $file = $_GET['file'];
  include($file);  // Vulnerable to path traversal
  ```

- **Indirect File Inclusion (using functions like `require`, `file_get_contents`, `fopen`, etc.):**
  ```php
  $page = $_GET['page'];
  include("pages/" . $page);  // May be exploited to include arbitrary files
  ```

- **File Upload Mechanisms:**
  When uploading files, the application may store files based on user input.
  ```php
  $target_dir = "uploads/";
  $target_file = $target_dir . basename($_FILES["file"]["name"]);
  move_uploaded_file($_FILES["file"]["tmp_name"], $target_file);  // If not sanitized, may lead to traversal attacks
  ```

### 3. **Examples and Detection Rules for SAST**

To effectively write rules for static application security testing (SAST), the following types of patterns should be considered:

1. **Detection based on Common Functions:**
   Identify the use of functions that operate on file paths and check if user input influences the path, such as `include`, `require`, `file_get_contents`, `fopen`, `readfile`, `opendir` etc.

2. **Patterns to Look For:**
   - Direct user input without sanitization.
   - Concatenation of paths with user input.
   - Functions like `realpath` or checks around dangerous functions (sanitization).

### Code Examples and SAST Rules

**Improper File Inclusion Example:**
```php
$page = $_GET['page'];
include("pages/" . $page);  // Potential path traversal
```
**SAST Rule:**
Check for use of `include`, `require`, and other file operation functions where the path is influenced by user input directly or indirectly.

**Properly Validated Example:**
```php
$page = basename($_GET['page']);  // Only permitted filename without directory traversal
include("pages/" . $page);
```


### 4. **Minimizing False Positives and False Negatives**

#### **Common Pitfalls:**
1. **Assuming User Input is Safe:** Never assume that input validation on the client side is sufficient.
2. **Incomplete Sanitization or Validation:** Ensure comprehensive validation. For example, using `realpath` and ensuring the file resides within the intended directory.
3. **Not Using Whitelisting:** Instead of blacklisting dangerous inputs, whitelist acceptable ones.

#### **Example of Whitelisting Approach:**
```php
$allowed_pages = ['home.php', 'about.php', 'contact.php'];
$page = $_GET['page'];
if (in_array($page, $allowed_pages)) {
    include("pages/" . $page);
} else {
    // Handle error
}
```

### 5. **Edge Cases and Common Input Validation Routines**

#### Edge Cases:
- **Encoding Issues:** Malicious users may encode special characters to bypass simple checks.
- **Null Byte Injections:** In some PHP configurations, a null byte (%00) can terminate strings early.
- **Double Encoding:** Handling cases where "%2E%2E%2F" could bypass naive filters.

#### Input Validation Routines:
1. **Using `realpath` to Canonicalize Paths:**
   ```php
   $file = $_GET['file'];
   $base_dir = '/var/www/html/uploads/';
   $realpath = realpath($base_dir . $file);
   if ($realpath && strpos($realpath, $base_dir) === 0) {
       include($realpath);
   } else {
       // Handle error
   }
   ```

### 6. **Conclusion**

Writing effective SAST rules to detect improper limitation of a pathname to a restricted directory in PHP involves understanding the underlying mechanics of the vulnerability, identifying common patterns, and using robust input validation techniques to prevent exploitation. Reducing false positives and negatives requires comprehensive input validation, whitelisting acceptable paths, and being aware of potential pitfalls such as encoding issues and null byte injections.
