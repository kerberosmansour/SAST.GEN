# Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection') (CWE-078) in PHP

###### Understanding Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command (OS Command Injection)

OS Command Injection, also known as shell injection, occurs when an application constructs an operating system command using untrusted user-supplied data. If this data is not properly sanitized, an attacker can manipulate the command to execute arbitrary OS commands.

### How OS Command Injection Manifests in PHP

In PHP, shell commands can be executed using various functions like `system()`, `exec()`, `shell_exec()`, `passthru()`, and others. If the input to these functions is not correctly neutralized, it can lead to command injection vulnerabilities.

#### Example 1: Basic Command Injection
```php
<?php
$user_input = $_GET['input'];
system('ls ' . $user_input);
?>
```
If an attacker passes `; rm -rf /`, the command executed will be `ls ; rm -rf /`, potentially leading to severe damage.

#### Example 2: Using `exec()` Function
```php
<?php
$user_input = $_POST['input'];
exec("grep $user_input filename");
?>
```
Here, if `input` is `blah; cat /etc/passwd`, it will result in `grep blah; cat /etc/passwd filename`, which will also execute the `cat` command.

#### Example 3: Framework-Specific Example (Laravel)
In Laravel, shell commands can be executed using the `Artisan::call()` or `Process` class.
```php
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Artisan;
$command = $_GET['command'];
Artisan::call("migrate --step=" . $command);
```
If `command` is `1; ls`, this can lead to arbitrary command execution.

### Writing SAST Rules for Detecting OS Command Injection

To write SAST (Static Application Security Testing) rules, it is crucial to focus on identifying the use of vulnerable PHP functions with untrusted input.

#### Steps:
1. **Pattern Matching:**
   Identify the usage of functions like `system()`, `exec()`, `shell_exec()`, `passthru()`, `popen()`, `proc_open()` etc.
   
2. **Trace User Input:**
   Track the source of variables passed into these functions to see if they originate from user input (`$_GET`, `$_POST`, `$_REQUEST`, etc.).

3. **Data Flow Analysis:**
   Ensure the variables are properly sanitized using functions like `escapeshellarg()` or `escapeshellcmd()`. For example:
   ```php
   $sanitized_input = escapeshellarg($_GET['input']);
   system('ls ' . $sanitized_input);
   ```

### Detailed Example of Detection Rule

#### Source Identification
```regex
\$_(GET|POST|REQUEST|COOKIE|SERVER)\['[\w\d_]+'\]
```
This regex identifies user input from superglobals.

#### Sink Identification
```regex
system\s*\(|exec\s*\(|shell_exec\s*\(|passthru\s*\(|popen\s*\(|proc_open\s*\(
```
This regex identifies function calls that can execute shell commands.

#### Ensuring Proper Neutralization
Look for the application of `escapeshellarg()` or `escapeshellcmd()`.
```regex
escapeshell(arg|cmd)\s*\(\s*\$_(GET|POST|REQUEST|COOKIE|SERVER)\['[\w\d_]+'\]\s*\)
```

### Minimizing False Positives and False Negatives

**Common Pitfalls:**
1. **Indirect Variables:**
   Be cautious of indirect assignments that might lead to command execution.
   
   Example:
   ```php
   $command = $_POST['cmd'];
   system($command);
   ```

2. **Partially Sanitized Input:**
   Ensure full command context is sanitized.
   
   Example:
   ```php
   $input = escapeshellarg($_POST['cmd']);
   system("grep $input /var/log/syslog");
   ```

Even though `grep $input` might be safe, always check the entire command context.

**Edge Cases:**
1. **Parameter Reuse:**
   Parameters reused in different contexts might bypass initial sanitization.
   
   Example:
   ```php
   $param = $_GET['cmd'];
   $sanitized_param = escapeshellarg($param);
   // Later reused unsanitized
   system("ls " . $param);
   ```

2. **Dynamic Function Calls:**
   Be wary of dynamically constructed function calls.
   
   Example:
   ```php
   $function = "system";
   $function($_GET['cmd']);
   ```

### Conclusion

By understanding the various ways OS Command Injection can appear in PHP and writing comprehensive detection rules, you can effectively minimize false negatives and false positives. Always remember to validate the entire command context and monitor for indirect and dynamic usage of potentially dangerous functions.
