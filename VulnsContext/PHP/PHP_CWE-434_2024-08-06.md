# Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type (CWE-434) in PHP

###### Understanding Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type

Unrestricted upload of file with dangerous type is a significant security issue that allows attackers to upload malicious files, which can ultimately compromise the server and data integrity. This type of vulnerability is mapped under [CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/434.html) and can lead to threats such as remote code execution, resource exhaustion, and unauthorized data access.

Here's how this vulnerability typically manifests in applications written in PHP:

1. **Lack of Input Validation**: The application does not validate the file type or size, allowing potentially dangerous files to be uploaded.
2. **Improper Handling of Uploaded Files**: The application might store files in an insecure location or fail to sanitize file names, allowing path traversal and other attacks.
3. **Trust on MIME Type Headers**: Relying solely on MIME types provided by clients, which can be spoofed.

### Variations of the Vulnerability in PHP

Unrestricted file uploads can appear in various ways, especially in different PHP frameworks and coding patterns. Below are detailed examples of this vulnerability in different contexts:

#### Example 1: Plain PHP Upload Script
```php
if(isset($_FILES['uploaded_file'])) {
    $errors = [];
    $file_name = $_FILES['uploaded_file']['name'];
    $file_size = $_FILES['uploaded_file']['size'];
    $file_tmp = $_FILES['uploaded_file']['tmp_name'];
    $file_type = $_FILES['uploaded_file']['type'];

    // No restriction on file type and size
    move_uploaded_file($file_tmp,"uploads/".$file_name);

    if(empty($errors) == true){
        echo "File Uploaded Successfully";
    } else {
        print_r($errors);
    }
}
```
*Issues*: No validation on file type and size, stores the file with user-provided name, which can lead to overwriting sensitive files or path traversal.

#### Example 2: Laravel Framework
```php
Route::post('/upload', function (Request $request) {
    $path = $request->file('photo')->store('photos');
    return $path;
});
```
*Issues*: The above code does not validate the file type or size. Attackers could upload executable files if the storage path is publicly accessible.

#### Example 3: Using Symfony Framework
```php
use Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\Request;
use Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\File\UploadedFile;

public function uploadAction(Request $request)
{
    $file = $request->files->get('file');
    if ($file instanceof UploadedFile) {
        $file->move('/uploads', $file->getClientOriginalName());
    }
}
```
*Issues*: Similar to the plain PHP script, no validation on file type and size, and stores the file by its original name.

### SAST Rule Creation Guidance

To help an author of SAST tool detection rules understand and accurately detect Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type, consider the following:

#### Understand the Vulnerability
1. **Validate File Extensions**: Ensure that only specific file types are allowed.
2. **Validate File Content**: MIME type checks and magic number inspections.
3. **File Size Validation**: Limit the size to prevent denial of service attacks.
4. **Sanitize File Names**: Prevent path traversal attacks by sanitizing the file names.


#### Detailed Code Examples

1. **Example with Validations in Plain PHP**
```php
$allowed_extensions = ['jpg', 'jpeg', 'png', 'gif'];
$max_file_size = 1048576; // 1MB

if(isset($_FILES['uploaded_file'])) {
    $errors = [];
    $file_name = basename($_FILES['uploaded_file']['name']);
    $file_size = $_FILES['uploaded_file']['size'];
    $file_tmp = $_FILES['uploaded_file']['tmp_name'];
    $file_ext = pathinfo($file_name, PATHINFO_EXTENSION);

    // Validate file extension
    if (!in_array($file_ext, $allowed_extensions)) {
        $errors[] = "Extension not allowed";
    }

    // Validate file size
    if ($file_size > $max_file_size) {
        $errors[] = "File size exceeds limit";
    }

    if (empty($errors)) {
        $new_file_name = uniqid() . '.' . $file_ext;
        move_uploaded_file($file_tmp,"uploads/" . $new_file_name);
        echo "File Uploaded Successfully";
    } else {
        print_r($errors);
    }
}
```

2. **Example in Laravel**
```php
use Illuminate\Http\Request;

Route::post('/upload', function (Request $request) {
    $request->validate([
        'photo' => 'file|mimes:jpg,jpeg,png,gif|max:1024', // validate file type and size
    ]);

    $path = $request->file('photo')->store('photos');
    return $path;
});
```

3. **Example in Symfony**
```php
use Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\Request;
use Symfony\Component\Validator\Constraints as Assert;

public function uploadAction(Request $request)
{
    $file = $request->files->get('file');
    $errors = $this->get('validator')->validate($file, [
        new Assert\File([
            'maxSize' => '1M',
            'mimeTypes' => ['image/jpeg', 'image/png', 'image/gif'],
        ])
    ]);

    if (count($errors) === 0 && $file instanceof UploadedFile) {
        $file->move('/uploads', uniqid() . '.' . $file->guessExtension());
        return new Response('File Uploaded Successfully');
    } else {
        return new Response('Invalid File Upload');
    }
}
```

### Accurate Detection

**Minimizing False Positives**
1. Ensure rules check for presence of both file validation (size/type) and secure storage mechanisms.
2. Look for contexts where file upload paths are dynamically constructed from user input without sanitization.

**Minimizing False Negatives**
1. Emphasize rules to inspect for key functions like `move_uploaded_file`, `store`, and `storeAs`.
2. Identify common frameworks' methods for file uploads (e.g., `Laravel Request::file`, `Symfony Request::files`).

**Common Pitfalls**
- Over-reliance on MIME types can lead to spoofed file types being accepted.
- Not generating unique filenames can lead to file overwriting.
- Storing files within the webroot without access control can expose files publicly.
