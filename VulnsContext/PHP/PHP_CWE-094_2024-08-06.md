# Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection') (CWE-094) in PHP

###### Understanding Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection') in PHP

#### What is Code Injection?
Code Injection happens when an attacker is able to introduce or alter existing code in an application, typically through input fields or other forms of data entry. This untrusted data gets interpreted as code by the application, leading to various malicious activities such as unauthorized data access, data manipulation, or full control of the application.

In PHP, this often happens via functions that evaluate strings as code, which includes:
- `eval()`
- `assert()`
- `preg_replace()` with `/e` modifier
- `create_function()`

### Examples and Variations in PHP

#### Basic Example Using `eval()`

```php
<?php
$input = $_GET['input'];
eval("\$code = $input;");
```

In this example, an attacker can supply malicious input such as:
```
http://example.com/page.php?input='; system('ls'); //'
```

This would execute the `ls` command on the server, potentially exposing file names to the attacker.

#### Example Using `assert()`

```php
<?php
$input = $_GET['input'];
assert($input);
```

The `assert()` function can evaluate a string as PHP code. Malicious input such as:
```
http://example.com/page.php?input=phpinfo()
```

This triggers the `phpinfo()` function, exposing sensitive server information.

#### Example Using `preg_replace()` with `/e` Modifier

```php
<?php
$input = $_GET['input'];
preg_replace("/a/e", $input, "a");
```

The `/e` modifier treats the replacement string as PHP code. An attacker could supply code to be executed, like:
```
http://example.com/page.php?input=phpinfo();
```

This would expose the PHP configuration.

#### Example Using `create_function()`

```php
<?php
$input = $_GET['input'];
$f = create_function('', $input);
$f();
```

Here, the input directly constructs a function, allowing malicious code execution.

### Writing SAST Rules for Code Injection Detection

#### Rule Components to Focus On:

1. **Function Calls**:
   - Target functions that can execute code: `eval()`, `assert()`, `preg_replace()` with `/e`, `create_function()`.
   
2. **Unvalidated Input**:
   - Check if these functions use unvalidated/unfiltered user input directly.

3. **Code Context Analysis**:
   - Analyze the data flow to ensure that inputs reach these functions without proper sanitization.

### Example SAST Rule for Detecting `eval()`

```regex
eval\s*\(\s*[$_GET|$_POST|$_REQUEST|$_COOKIE]\[
```

This regex targets `eval()` calls that are directly using superglobal arrays.

### Example SAST Rule for Detecting `assert()`

```regex
assert\s*\(\s*[$_GET|$_POST|$_REQUEST|$_COOKIE]\[
```

Similar to `eval()`, but targeting `assert()`.

### False Positives Considerations
Analyze for proper sanitization:
- Check for functions like `htmlspecialchars()`, `filter_var()`, `preg_replace()` without `/e`, etc.
- Ensure that any input used in these functions has passed through context-aware escaping mechanisms.

### Edge Cases
1. **Implicit Function Invocation**: Use of string manipulation which indirectly leads to code execution.
2. **Dynamic Variable Names**: Functions or constructs that build variable names dynamically and then use them in `eval()`.

#### PHP with Frameworks (e.g., Laravel, CodeIgniter)

Consider framework-specific functions that may wrap these native calls or provide utility functions leading to similar risks.

#### Laravel Example

```php
Route::get('/user/{id}', function ($id) {
    eval($id);
});
```

SAST rules should account for framework-specific routing and request processing methods.

### Minimizing False Negatives and Positives
- **Comprehensive Input Sources**: Consider all input mechanisms, not just superglobals (e.g., `input()`, `Request::get()`, etc.).
- **Contextual Awareness**: Use abstract syntax trees (AST) to understand the context in which input is used.
- **Sanitization Checking**: Identify known sanitization/validation functions.

### Conclusion
Code injection vulnerabilities in PHP stem from improper handling of user inputs in functions capable of executing code. Writing effective SAST rules involves targeting specific functions (`eval()`, `assert()`, etc.), ensuring comprehensive analysis of all input sources, and validating that they have not been sanitized properly. By understanding the varied contexts and risks, one can craft robust detection rules that minimize false positives and negatives【4:0†source】【4:1†source】【4:2†source】【4:3†source】【4:4†source】.
