# Access of Resource Using Incompatible Type ('Type Confusion') (CWE-843) in PHP

#### Understanding Access of Resource Using Incompatible Type ('Type Confusion')

### Definition and Manifestation in PHP

Type Confusion in PHP refers to a vulnerability that occurs when variable types are incorrectly assumed or validated, causing inappropriate access or actions on resources due to unexpected data types. This can lead to various security issues such as unauthorized access, data corruption, or unexpected behavior. This vulnerability is often caused by weak type-checking and coercion in PHP.

### Variations of Type Confusion in PHP

#### Weak Typing Example

PHP's weak typing system allows implicit type conversion, which can lead to type confusion:

```php
<?php
// Function expects an integer but gets a string
function processOrder(int $orderID) {
    // Potential type confusion if $orderID is not an integer
    echo "Processing order ID: " . $orderID;
}

// This call will work fine due to type coercion, but is dangerous
processOrder("123abc");
?>
```

Here, the function `processOrder` expects an integer, but calling it with a string `'123abc'` will lead to unpredictable behavior due to PHP's implicit type conversion.

#### Object Injection Example in PHP

PHP type confusion can also involve object injection, particularly in deserialization scenarios:

```php
<?php
class Logger {
    private $logFile;

    public function __construct($file) {
        $this->logFile = $file;
    }

    public function log($message) {
        file_put_contents($this->logFile, $message.PHP_EOL, FILE_APPEND);
    }
}

class User {
    public $name;
}

$input = unserialize($_GET['data']);
// If an attacker passes a serialized Logger object, they can manipulate the log file
$input->log("This is a log message");
?>
```

If an attacker passes a serialized `Logger` object, they can manipulate the `$logFile` property to point to sensitive files and inject log messages into these files.

#### Type Confusion with Arrays and Strings

PHP allows arrays to be used as strings in certain contexts, leading to type confusion:

```php
<?php
function readSettings($userID) {
    // Assume $userID to be a string, but it might be an array
    $settingsFile = fopen("/path/to/settings_" . $userID . ".txt", "r");
    if ($settingsFile) {
        $settings = fread($settingsFile, filesize("/path/to/settings_" . $userID . ".txt"));
        fclose($settingsFile);
        return $settings;
    }
    return null;
}

// If $userID is an array, this will result in a warning and potentially unpredictable behavior
readSettings(['user']);
?>
```

### Guidance for Writing SAST Rules

#### Rule Creation Process

1. **Identify Data Sources**: Detect points in the code where user input or external data enters the system (e.g., through `$_GET`, `$_POST`, `file_get_contents`, etc.).
2. **Track Data Flow**: Trace the flow of this data through the application, specifically looking for points where type conversion or type-dependent operations occur.
3. **Check Type Conversions**: Identify locations where variables are cast or implicitly converted and verify if the type conversion can lead to type confusion.
4. **Validate Before Use**: Ensure that validations and checks are in place before operations that depend on specific types.

#### Code Examples for SAST Rule Authoring

1. **Weak Typing Detection**:
   Detect functions that expect a specific type and are called with mismatched types:

   ```php
   // Detecting type hint mismatch
   function find_type_mismatch() {
       foreach ($tokens as $token) {
           if ($token is a string but context expects an integer) {
               flag as type confusion;
           }
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Potential Object Injection Points**:
   Identify places where data is unserialized and check if it leads to methods that can be manipulated:

   ```php
   // Detecting unsafe unserialize usage
   if (strpos($code, 'unserialize(') !== false) {
       if (untrusted_data_source($code_before_unserialize)) {
           flag as potential object injection;
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Array vs. String Confusion**:
   Trace variables that are used interchangeably as arrays and strings:

   ```php
   // Detect array-to-string conversion
   if ($variable is array and used as string) {
       flag as potential type confusion;
   }
   ```

### Minimizing False Positives and False Negatives:

1. **Strict Type Checking**: Emphasize strict type checks and casts in the rule, and flag any deviations.
2. **Pattern Matching**: Use comprehensive pattern matching to identify where type assumptions might be violated.
3. **Context Awareness**: Incorporate context about how variables are used across different parts of the application to avoid flagging legitimate code.

### Avoiding Common Pitfalls

1. **Implicit Type Conversion**: Be aware of PHP's implicit type conversion and ensure rules account for potential type juggling.
2. **Framework-Specific Practices**: Be mindful of how different frameworks (like Laravel, Symfony) handle type casting and validation, and tailor rules accordingly.
3. **Comprehensive Input Validation**: Always validate inputs from untrusted sources using appropriate validation routines to match expected types.

By following these guidelines, SAST tool authors can create robust rules to detect and mitigate type confusion vulnerabilities in PHP applications. These rules should effectively minimize false positives and negatives, providing accurate and actionable insights for developers.
