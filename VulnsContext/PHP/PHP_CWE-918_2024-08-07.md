# Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) (CWE-918) in PHP

###### Understanding Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) in PHP

**Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)** is a vulnerability that happens when a web application fetches a remote resource without properly validating user-supplied URLs. This vulnerability allows attackers to force the application to send crafted requests to unexpected destinations, including internal systems potentially protected by firewalls.

### Variations of SSRF in PHP

SSRF can manifest in various ways in PHP applications. Below is a detailed explanation along with code examples illustrating different contexts where SSRF can occur, including common PHP frameworks and patterns.

#### Basic Example of SSRF

In a simple PHP application, an SSRF vulnerability might look like the following:

```php
<?php
// Example 1: Simple cURL request
$url = $_GET['url'];
$ch = curl_init();
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_URL, $url);
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, true);
$response = curl_exec($ch);
curl_close($ch);
echo $response;
?>
```
In this example, an attacker can manipulate the `url` parameter to force the server to make a request to an undesired resource, such as `http://localhost/admin`.

#### SSRF in PHP with Popular Frameworks

##### Laravel Example

Laravel, a popular PHP framework, can be vulnerable to SSRF if inputs are not properly validated. Here is an example:

```php
<?php

use Illuminate\Http\Request;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Http;

Route::get('/fetch', function (Request $request) {
    $url = $request->query('url');
    $response = Http::get($url);
    return $response;
});
```

##### Symfony Example

In Symfony, a similar vulnerability can exist when using the HTTP client component:

```php
<?php

use Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\Request;
use Symfony\Contracts\HttpClient\HttpClientInterface;

public function fetchAction(Request $request, HttpClientInterface $httpClient)
{
    $url = $request->query->get('url');
    $response = $httpClient->request('GET', $url);
    return $this->json(['data' => $response->getContent()]);
}
```

### Creating Effective SAST Rules for SSRF Detection

To effectively create SAST rules that detect SSRF vulnerabilities in PHP code, it's important to understand the sources (input points) and sinks (functions or methods making the external request).

**Detection Goals:**
- Minimize false negatives (undetected vulnerabilities)
- Reduce false positives (incorrectly flagged code)

#### Common Sources

1. **_GET, _POST, _REQUEST, _COOKIE, _SERVER**: User input variables.
   ```php
   $url = $_GET['url'];
   ```

2. **Framework-specific request handlers**: Laravel's `Request::query` and Symfony’s `Request::query->get`.

#### Common Sinks

1. **cURL functions**: `curl_init`, `curl_setopt`, `curl_exec`.
2. **file_get_contents**: Used to get the content of a file or URL.
   ```php
   $response = file_get_contents($url);
   ```

3. **HTTP clients**: Framework-specific clients such as Laravel's `Http::get` and Symfony's `HttpClientInterface`.

#### Example SAST Rule
A SAST rule should trace input from common sources to risky functions. For instance:

1. Identify user input:
   ```regex
   (\$_GET|\$_POST|\$_REQUEST|\$_COOKIE|\$_SERVER)\[.*\]
   ```

2. Identify URL usage in sensitive functions:
   ```regex
   curl_setopt\(\s*\$?\w+\s*,\s*CURLOPT_URL\s*,\s*\$?(\w+)\s*\)
   file_get_contents\(\s*\$?(\w+)\s*\)
   Http::get\(\s*\$?(\w+)\s*\)
   ```

3. Match the input from user-supplied sources:
   ```regex
   (\$_GET|\$_POST|\$_REQUEST|\$_COOKIE|\$_SERVER)\['\w+'\]\s*;
   ```

Combine these patterns to trace whether user input reaches these functions without proper sanitization or validation.

### Common Pitfalls and Edge Cases

1. **Redirection Chains**: Ensure your rules handle URL redirects within the application.
2. **Whitelist Validation**: Ensure URLs from a whitelist are handled and validated correctly.
3. **DNS Rebinding and TOCTOU**: URL consistency checks to avoid DNS rebinding and "time of check, time of use" race conditions【4:0†source】【4:3†source】【4:6†source】【4:8†source】.

### Conclusion

Writing effective SAST rules for detecting SSRF in PHP involves identifying user input points and ensuring they do not reach sensitive sinks without proper validation. The rules should be crafted in such a way that they recognize various coding patterns across different PHP frameworks to minimize false positives and negatives.
