# Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference (CWE-611) in PHP

###### Understanding Improper Restriction of XML External Entity (XXE) Reference

**Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference**, commonly known as XXE, is a vulnerability that occurs when an XML parser processes XML input containing a reference to an external entity. When the parser is weakly configured, it can lead to a range of attacks such as Denial of Service (DoS), Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF), port scanning, and other impacts on the system【4:0†source】.

### Variations in PHP

XXE vulnerabilities manifest in various ways in PHP applications, particularly across different frameworks and coding patterns. Here are some examples:

#### 1. Plain PHP Example

```php
$xml = file_get_contents('php://input');
$dom = new DOMDocument();
$dom->loadXML($xml, LIBXML_NOENT | LIBXML_DTDLOAD); // Vulnerable line
echo $dom->textContent;
```

#### 2. Using SimpleXML

```php
$xml = file_get_contents('php://input');
simplexml_load_string($xml, 'SimpleXMLElement', LIBXML_NOENT | LIBXML_DTDLOAD); // Vulnerable line
```

#### 3. In Laravel Framework

Laravel uses the `simplexml_load_string` function in some parts. If this function is used insecurely, it could lead to XXE vulnerabilities.

```php
class SomeController extends Controller
{
    public function parse(Request $request)
    {
        $xml = $request->input('xml');
        $parsed = simplexml_load_string($xml, 'SimpleXMLElement', LIBXML_NOENT | LIBXML_DTDLOAD); // Vulnerable line
        // Further processing...
    }
}
```

### Creating SAST Rules for Detecting XXE

To create effective SAST (Static Application Security Testing) rules for detecting XXE vulnerabilities, the rules must accurately identify patterns associated with insecure XML parsing without generating false positives or negatives.

#### 1. General Rule for Any PHP XML Parsing

Identify all instances of XML parsing and check if they securely handle external entities.

**Pattern to Look For:**
- `loadXML`
- `simplexml_load_string`
- `XMLReader::open`

**Rule Template:**
```regex
\b(DOMDocument::loadXML|simplexml_load_string|XMLReader::open)\b\s*\(.*\b(LIBXML_NOENT|LIBXML_DTDLOAD)\b
```

**Explanation:** This regex pattern looks for `loadXML`, `simplexml_load_string`, or `XMLReader::open` functions with potentially insecure flags such as `LIBXML_NOENT` and `LIBXML_DTDLOAD`.

#### 2. Framework-Specific Rules (Laravel Example)

In Laravel projects, the same pattern might manifest in controller methods or service classes.

**Pattern to Look For:**
- Occurrences of `simplexml_load_string` within methods.

**Rule Template:**
```regex
function\s+\w+\s*\(.*\)\s*\{.*\bsimplexml_load_string\b\s*\(.*\b(LIBXML_NOENT|LIBXML_DTDLOAD)\b
```

**Explanation:** This regex detects function definitions containing `simplexml_load_string` with insecure flags.

### Common Pitfalls and Edge Cases

1. **Ignoring Parameter Contexts**: Ensure that the context of the XML input source is validated.
2. **Conditional Disabling of DTDs**: Sometimes, DTDs might be conditionally enabled. Static analysis should also cover conditional logic enabling these flags.
3. **Custom Parsers**: Custom wrappers around XML parsers might evade direct detection rules. Focus on patterns around XML parsing calls.

### Recommended Mitigations

1. **Disable DTDs and External Entities**:
    ```php
    $dom = new DOMDocument();
    $dom->loadXML($xml, LIBXML_NOENT | LIBXML_DTDLOAD);
    $dom->resolveExternals = false;
    $dom->substituteEntities = false;
    ```

2. **Use Secure Configuration Settings**:
    ```php
    $dom = new DOMDocument();
    $dom->loadXML($xml); // Default settings without LIBXML_NOENT and LIBXML_DTDLOAD
    ```

3. **Validate and Sanitize Input**:
    Ensure that only trusted sources can supply XML content and validate the structure and content of the XML.

### Conclusion

Creating effective SAST rules for detecting XXE involves a strong understanding of how the vulnerability can manifest, especially in common PHP frameworks. By integrating these detection patterns into your SAST tools and adhering to secure coding practices, you can mitigate the risks associated with XXE vulnerabilities【4:0†source】【4:1†source】.
