# Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection') (CWE-077) in PHP

###### Understanding Command Injection in PHP

**Command Injection** occurs when an application constructs a command string based on user input and then executes it on the system shell, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary commands. In PHP, this can occur through functions such as `exec()`, `shell_exec()`, `system()`, `passthru()`, and backticks (`` `cmd` ``).

**How it Manifests:**
1. Unsafe execution of system commands with user input.
2. Lack of proper input validation and sanitization.
3. Direct concatenation of user inputs in command strings.

### Examples and Variations

#### 1. Basic Command Injection
An application directly concatenates user input into a command string:
```php
<?php
$user = $_GET['user'];
system("id $user");
?>
```
If an attacker sends `?user=; cat /etc/passwd`, the command becomes:
```bash
id ; cat /etc/passwd
```
This will execute both the `id` and `cat /etc/passwd` commands.

#### 2. Using `escapeshellcmd()` Incorrectly
While `escapeshellcmd()` and `escapeshellarg()` can help mitigate risks, improper usage still leaves vulnerabilities:
```php
<?php
$user = $_GET['user'];
system("id " . escapeshellcmd($user));
?>
```
The command becomes `id 'attacker\'s input'`, which is safe, but specific complex inputs might bypass this poorly applied measure.

### Guidance for Writing SAST Rules

**1. Identify Command Execution Functions:**
   - Target functions like `exec()`, `shell_exec()`, `system()`, `passthru()`, and backticks (`` `cmd` ``).

**2. Detect Unsafe Input Usage:**
   - Analyze if user input (`$_GET`, `$_POST`, `$_REQUEST`, etc.) is directly concatenated into command strings without sanitization:
   ```php
   system("command " . $user_input);
   ```
   
**3. Check for Proper Sanitization Techniques:**
   - Validate the presence of `escapeshellarg()` or `escapeshellcmd()` and ensure they are correctly used.

**4. Examples of Patterns to Detect:**

**Direct Command Injection:**
```php
exec("ls " . $_GET['dir']);
```

**With Basic Escaping (partially mitigated but not foolproof):**
```php
exec("ls " . escapeshellcmd($_GET['dir']));
```

**Secure Usage:**
```php
exec("ls " . escapeshellarg($_GET['dir']));
```

### Pitfalls and Edge Cases

**False Positives:**
- Identifying sanitized inputs as unsafe if not accurately verifying the application of security functions like `escapeshellarg()`.

**False Negatives:**
- Missing complex injection scenarios where multiple sanitization stages or different input sources can lead to vulnerabilities:
```php
$user = filter_input(INPUT_GET, 'user', FILTER_SANITIZE_STRING);
system("id " . $user);
```
This is somewhat sanitized but may still be vulnerable if special characters are not properly handled.

### Additional Considerations

**Framework-Specific Injection:**
- Detect patterns across common PHP frameworks (e.g., Laravel, Symfony):
  - Laravel's `Artisan` commands, Yii Framework's `console controllers`.

### Comprehensive Detection Tips

1. **Prioritize Direct Command Executions:**
   - Rule should flag any instance of command execution functions.
2. **Analyze Input Flow:**
   - Track data flow from user input to the command execution point.
3. **Sanitization Verification:**
   - Ensure security functions `escapeshellarg()` and `escapeshellcmd()` are correctly utilized in proximity to the command execution.

**Conclusion:**
Properly understanding the intricacies of command injection in PHP, along with thorough analysis of user inputs and their sanitization, is crucial for accurate SAST rule development. Balancing the detection of actual vulnerabilities while minimizing false positives and negatives is key for effective application security.
