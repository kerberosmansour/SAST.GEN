# Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) (CWE-918) in PHP

###### Understanding Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)

**Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)** is a security vulnerability that allows an attacker to make requests from a web server to unintended locations. The attacker can coerce the server to send crafted requests to internal-only services or resources, potentially bypassing firewalls, VPNs, or other access control lists (ACLs).

### Variations of SSRF in PHP

SSRF can manifest in several ways in PHP applications, commonly through functions that facilitate HTTP requests. Below, I provide examples of SSRF vulnerabilities using different functions and libraries:

1. **Using cURL:**
    ```php
    $url = $_GET['url'];
    $ch = curl_init();
    curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_URL, $url);
    curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, 1);
    $response = curl_exec($ch);
    curl_close($ch);
    echo $response;
    ```

2. **Using file_get_contents:**
    ```php
    $url = $_GET['url'];
    $response = file_get_contents($url);
    echo $response;
    ```

3. **Using fopen:**
    ```php
    $url = $_GET['url'];
    $handle = fopen($url, "r");
    while ($line = fgets($handle)) {
        echo $line;
    }
    fclose($handle);
    ```

4. **Using Guzzle in Laravel:**
    ```php
    $client = new \GuzzleHttp\Client();
    $url = $request->input('url');
    $response = $client->get($url);
    return $response->getBody();
    ```

### Writing SAST Rules for Detecting SSRF

Writing SAST rules involves understanding how SSRF vulnerabilities can be exploited, and hence flagging patterns where dynamic user input influences the URLs being fetched without proper validation. Here's a guide to writing effective SAST rules:

1. **Identify Sensitive Functions:**
   Detect usages of functions and methods known to make HTTP requests, such as:
    - `curl_init()`
    - `file_get_contents()`
    - `fopen()`
    - Third-party libraries like `GuzzleHttp\Client::get`

2. **Track User Inputs:**
   Trace user inputs that may influence these sensitive functions. This includes:
    - `$_GET[]`, `$_POST[]`, `$_REQUEST[]`
    - Methods like `$request->input()`, `$request->get()` in frameworks like Laravel

3. **Implement Positive URL Validation:**
   Ensure the URL meets specific criteria using allow lists:
    - Allowed domain names
    - Allowed schemas (e.g., `http` and `https` only)
    - Restrict against local addresses (e.g., `localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, `169.254.169.254`).

### Accurate SSRF Detection

To minimize false positives and negatives, consider the following:

1. **Contextual Analysis:**
   Evaluate where the user input is coming from and whether it directly affects the URL parameters.

2. **Complex Data Flows:**
   Track complex data flows and intermediate variables where user input may be assigned before being used in a request.

3. **False Positive Reduction:**
   Don't flag code that has appropriate validation, such as allow-listed domains or schemas. Example:
    ```php
    $allowed_domains = ['example.com', 'api.example.com'];
    $url = $_GET['url'];
    $parsed_url = parse_url($url);
    if (in_array($parsed_url['host'], $allowed_domains)) {
        // proceed with request
    }
    ```

### Common Pitfalls and Edge Cases

1. **DNS Rebinding:**
   An attacker may exploit DNS rebinding techniques to bypass domain restrictions.

2. **TOCTOU (Time-of-Check to Time-of-Use) Issues:**
   Ensure URLs are validated just before making the request to avoid changes after initial validation.

3. **Empty and Relative URLs:**
   Handle cases where an attacker might try to provide empty or relative URLs that resolve to internal addresses.
