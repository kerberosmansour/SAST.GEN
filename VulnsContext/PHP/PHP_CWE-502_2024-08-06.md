# Deserialization of Untrusted Data (CWE-502) in PHP

###### Understanding Deserialization of Untrusted Data in PHP

**Deserialization** involves converting data from a serialized format back into its original object format. In PHP, this has traditionally been done using the `unserialize()` function. **Deserialization of untrusted data** refers to the process where data that has not been fully validated or sanitized is deserialized, which may lead to various security vulnerabilities like remote code execution (RCE), denial-of-service (DoS), and more.

#### Examples of Deserialization Vulnerabilities in PHP

1. **Basic Example with Unserialize**:
    ```php
    <?php
    $user_input = $_GET['data'];
    $object = unserialize($user_input);
    ?>
    ```
    If an attacker sends a malicious payload like `O:8:"stdClass":1:{s:4:"test";s:4:"data";}`, it may lead to unexpected behavior or vulnerability.

2. **Deserialization in Popular PHP Frameworks**:
    - **Laravel**:
        Laravel utilizes various forms of data handling but care should be taken when unserializing data:
        ```php
        $encodedData = $request->input('encoded_data');
        $data = unserialize(base64_decode($encodedData));
        ```
        - A safer approach is to use JSON:
            ```php
            $encodedData = $request->input('encoded_data');
            $data = json_decode(base64_decode($encodedData), true);
            ```

### Guidance for Writing SAST Rules for Detecting Deserialization Vulnerabilities

1. **Identify the use of `unserialize()`**:
    - **Pattern**: Look for uses of the `unserialize()` function in the source code.
    - **Example Code**:
        ```php
        if (strpos($code, 'unserialize(') !== false) {
            echo "Potential use of unserialize found";
        }
        ```

2. **Determine the Source of Data Passed to `unserialize()`**:
    - Ensure that only serialized data from trusted sources is deserialized. Check if the argument to `unserialize()` is directly obtained from user input.
    - **Example Code**:
        ```php
        $user_input = $_POST['data'];
        $object = unserialize($user_input); // Flag this
        ```

3. **Check for Alternative Safe Data Formats**:
    - Prefer using `json_encode()` and `json_decode()` for data serialization and deserialization:
        ```php
        $json = $request->input('json_data');
        $data = json_decode($json, true);
        ```
    - **Pattern**: Detecting use of `json_decode()` in context:
        ```php
        if (strpos($code, 'json_decode(') !== false && strpos($code, 'unserialize(') === false) {
            echo "Use of safe json_decode function detected.";
        }
        ```

### Minimizing False Positives and False Negatives

1. **Contextual Analysis**:
    - Ensure SAST rules analyze the context where `unserialize()` is used. For instance, check whether the data passed to `unserialize()` is derived from a trusted or a sanitized source.
    
2. **Data Flow Analysis**:
    - Perform a data flow analysis to trace the origin of the variables being deserialized. This helps in identifying if the data is coming from untrusted sources like user input.
    
3. **Function Wrappers and Custom Functions**:
    - Extend the rule detection to include custom wrapper functions around `unserialize()`, which are commonly used in large codebases:
        ```php
        function safe_unserialize($data) {
            return unserialize($data);
        }
        
        $data = $request->input('data');
        $object = safe_unserialize($data); // Track safe_unserialize as well
        ```

### Common Pitfalls

1. **Incomplete Tracing**:
    - Ensure that all instances of deserialization are properly traced, including those in third-party libraries or indirect calls.
    
2. **Ignoring Encoding Layers**:
    - Be cognizant of additional layers of data encoding/decoding such as Base64 encoding or custom encryption mechanisms that may hide direct uses of `unserialize()`. 

3. **Misidentifying Safe Data Sources**:
    - Do not assume data is safe purely based on its origin; always validate and sanitize inputs even from semi-trusted sources like database entries or configuration files.

By addressing these considerations, SAST rules can be more accurate and reliable in detecting deserialization vulnerabilities while minimizing noise and missed detections.
