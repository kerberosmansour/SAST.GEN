# Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') (CWE-079) in PHP

###### Understanding Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-Site Scripting') in PHP

#### What is Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)?

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is a vulnerability that allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into content that is then delivered to the victim’s browser. These scripts can hijack sessions, deface websites, insert hostile content, redirect users, and perform various other malicious actions.

#### Variations of XSS in PHP

In PHP applications, XSS typically occurs when user-supplied data is allowed to affect the HTML output without being properly neutralized (sanitized or escaped). Below are common scenarios in different PHP contexts:

1. **Reflected XSS:**
    - This occurs when data provided by the user is immediately included in the web page without proper sanitization. 

    ```php
    <?php
    echo "<h1>" . $_GET['title'] . "</h1>";
    ?>
    ```

2. **Stored XSS:**
    - This happens when user input is stored on the server and later included in web pages.

    ```php
    // Code to save input
    $comment = $_POST['comment'];
    saveToDatabase($comment);
    
    // Code to display saved comment
    echo "<p>" . $comment . "</p>";
    ```

3. **DOM-based XSS:**
    - This type occurs when the client-side script manipulates the DOM to include user input.

    ```html
    <script>
    document.getElementById("content").innerHTML = unescape(location.search.substring(1));
    </script>
    ```

### Writing SAST Rules for Detecting XSS in PHP

#### Core Concepts for SAST Rule Creation:

1. **Input Sources (Sources):**
    - Detect common input sources in PHP (`$_GET`, `$_POST`, `$_REQUEST`, `$_COOKIE`) and framework-specific inputs.

    ```php
    $_GET
    $_POST
    $_REQUEST
    $_COOKIE
    $_SERVER
    ```
    In frameworks like Laravel:
    ```php
    $request->input();
    ```

2. **Sinks:**
    - Identify where user input is directly used in the output, primarily functions like `echo`, `print`, `printf`, or manipulating the DOM in JS.

    ```php
    echo $input;
    print $input;
    printf($input);
    ```

3. **Sanitization and Validation:**
    - Ensure user inputs are sanitized (`htmlspecialchars`, `strip_tags`) and validated (`filter_var`, regex patterns).

    ```php
    htmlspecialchars($input, ENT_QUOTES, 'UTF-8');
    strip_tags($input);
    ```

#### Examples of SAST Rules and Code Patterns:

**Example 1:** Detecting Direct Inclusions:

```regex
echo\s+\$_(GET|POST|REQUEST|COOKIE)\[.*
```
This regex detects lines where `echo` is used to directly output data from superglobals.

**Example Code:**

```php
<?php
echo $_GET['input'];
?>
```

**Example 2:** Improper Escaping Detection:

```php
echo\s+.*[^htmlspecialchars|strip_tags]\(.*\);*
```
This rule could help identify cases where `echo` outputs a variable without proper sanitization functions like `htmlspecialchars` or `strip_tags`.

**Example Code:**

```php
<?php
echo "<p>" . $_POST['comments'] . "</p>";
?>
```

#### Edge Cases and Considerations:

1. **Bypass Mechanisms:**
    - Analyze scenarios where developers may attempt custom sanitization or filter only parts of the input. The SAST rules should consider common bypass techniques where only certain characters are sanitized.

    ```php
    // Insecure Sanitization
    function insecureSanitize($input) {
        return str_replace("<script>", "", $input);
    }
    ```

2. **Framework Nuances:**
    - Different PHP frameworks have different ways to handle requests and output. Ensure the code pattern considers the framework-specific methods. For Laravel:

    ```php
    {!! $request->input('data') !!}
    ```

3. **Complex Contexts:**
    - Evaluate how data flows across files and functions. Static analysis should trace input from sources, through intermediaries, to sinks.

### Conclusion

Detecting XSS vulnerabilities in PHP, especially through SAST, requires careful crafting of detection rules. Awareness of how user inputs are handled (sources), how they are sanitized (sanitizers), and where they are rendered (sinks) forms the backbone of creating rules that minimize false positives and negatives【4:0†source】    . Leveraging these concepts, security engineers can more effectively pinpoint and rectify XSS vulnerabilities within their PHP applications.
