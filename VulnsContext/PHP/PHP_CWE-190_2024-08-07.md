# Integer Overflow or Wraparound (CWE-190) in PHP

###### Understanding Integer Overflow or Wraparound in PHP

#### Definition and Manifestation

Integer overflow or wraparound occurs when an arithmetic operation attempts to create a numeric value that is outside the range representable with the allocated number of bits. In PHP, integers have a maximum value of `PHP_INT_MAX` (usually 2^31-1 for 32-bit systems and 2^63-1 for 64-bit systems). When an operation results in a value beyond this range, it wraps around to the negative end of the range.

### Variations in PHP

Integer overflow can appear in different contexts and patterns. Below are detailed examples showcasing these variations:

1. **Direct Arithmetic Operations:**

   ```php
   <?php
   $maxInt = PHP_INT_MAX;
   $result = $maxInt + 1;
   echo $result; // This will wrap around to a negative number
   ```

2. **User Input without Validation:**

   ```php
   <?php
   $input = $_GET['user_input'];
   $result = (int)$input + 1000; // Potential overflow if input is too large
   ```

3. **With Unsigned Integers in Binary Operations:**

   ```php
   <?php
   $largeValue = 0xFFFFFFFF; // 32-bit unsigned max
   $result = $largeValue + 1; // Wraparound in bitwise operations
   echo $result; // Outputs 0 due to wraparound
   ```

4. **Within PHP Frameworks (e.g., Laravel):**

   Database operations or other critical arithmetic operations in business logic may inadvertently cause overflows if not properly validated:

   ```php
   <?php
   $user = User::find(1);
   $incrementValue = $user->count + 1; // Potential overflow if $user->count is large
   ```

### Guide to Writing SAST Rules

#### Explanation for Rule Authors

Rule authors must understand the nature of integer overflow vulnerabilities: 
- They can lead to unexpected behavior, security exploits (e.g., bypassing conditions), or crashes.
- Effective SAST rules must identify potential overflow risks without overwhelming developers with false positives.

#### Code Examples Highlighting Vulnerability

Below are more PHP code snippets illustrating how integer overflow can be exploited:

1. **Basic Example:**

   ```php
   <?php
   $a = PHP_INT_MAX;
   $b = 1;
   $c = $a + $b; // c will be a wraparound value due to overflow
   ```

2. **From User Input:**

   ```php
   <?php
   $input = $_POST['input_value'];
   $result = 2 * (int)$input; // Vulnerable if input_value near halfway of PHP_INT_MAX
   ```

3. **Framework-based Example:**

   ```php
   <?php
   function updateCount($userId) {
       $user = User::find($userId);
       $user->count += 1; // Direct addition vulnerable to overflow
       $user->save();
   }
   ```

#### Reducing False Negatives and False Positives

SAST rules should focus on arithmetic operations involving:
- High-value constants (near PHP_INT_MAX).
- User or external input where improper validation could lead to large values.
- Loops or recursive functions where values accumulate.

**Consider Edge Cases:**
- Detect pattern where integers are cast to other types that may involve implicit conversion and potential overflow.
- Instances where data from external sources such as databases or APIs may not be sanitized/validated properly.

### Input Validation Routines

Ensure input validation checks that prevent overflow:

```php
<?php
function safeAdd($a, $b) {
    if (is_int($a) && is_int($b)) {
        if (($b > 0 && $a > PHP_INT_MAX - $b) ||
            ($b < 0 && $a < PHP_INT_MIN - $b)) {
            // Handle overflow condition
            throw new OverflowException("Integer overflow detected");
        }
    }
    return $a + $b;
}

$user_input = (int)$_POST['input'];
try {
    $safe_result = safeAdd($user_input, 1000);
} catch (OverflowException $e) {
    echo $e->getMessage();
}
```

### Conclusion

By understanding integer overflow/wraparound in the PHP language and using the provided examples, rule authors can develop more precise and effective SAST rules. These rules should focus on identifying operations prone to overflow, using thorough input validation strategies, and considering common pitfalls to minimize false positives and negatives. This approach will ensure robust detection of potential vulnerabilities in PHP applications    .
