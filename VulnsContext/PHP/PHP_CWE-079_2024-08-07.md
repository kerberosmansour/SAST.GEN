# Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') (CWE-079) in PHP

###### Understanding Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting'):

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is a vulnerability that allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by users. These scripts can then be executed in the context of the user’s browser, leading to session hijacking, defacement, or redirection to malicious sites. XSS manifests mainly because user input is not properly validated, filtered, or sanitized by the application, leading to the inclusion of scripts in web pages.

### Variations in PHP:

Cross-site scripting can appear in PHP applications in various ways and contexts:

1. **Reflected XSS**:
   - User input is taken, processed incorrectly, and rendered immediately in the page.
   - Example:
     ```php
     <?php echo "<div>" . $_GET['userInput'] . "</div>"; ?>
     ```
   - If a user submits `"><script>alert('XSS')</script>`, the output will include the script tag rendering it executable in the browser.

2. **Stored XSS**:
   - Malicious inputs are stored in databases and later rendered unsafely in the web page.
   - Example:
     ```php
     // Assume $db is a valid database connection
     $content = $_POST['content'];
     $db->query("INSERT INTO comments (content) VALUES ('$content')");
     // Later retrieved and displayed
     echo $comment['content'];
     ```
   - Attackers can store harmful scripts in the database, which are displayed later when a user visits the page.

3. **DOM-based XSS**:
   - The vulnerability exists in the client-side scripts manipulating DOM without proper sanitization.
   - Example:
     ```php
     <script>
         var userInput = "<?php echo $_GET['someParam']; ?>";
         document.getElementById("output").innerHTML = userInput;
     </script>
     ```
   - Misusing user inputs within the DOM can trigger XSS.

### SAST Rule Creation Guidance:

#### Understanding the Vulnerability and Exploitation:
To create accurate SAST rules, the author must understand the contexts where user data is inserted into the HTML without proper sanitization. The vulnerability can be exploited when the application:

- Uses unsanitized user input in HTML output, attributes, or JavaScript contexts directly.
- Relies on outdated or insufficient sanitization libraries.
- Fails to use encoding/escaping techniques like `htmlspecialchars`.

#### Code Examples:
1. **Basic Reflected XSS Detection**:
   ```php
   $userInput = $_GET['input'];
   echo "<div>$userInput</div>";  // Potential XSS
   ```
   Detection Goal: Identify unsanitized variables outputting to HTML.

2. **Stored XSS Detection**:
   ```php
   $userComment = $_POST['comment'];
   // Stored in a database and retrieved later
   $comment = $db->query("SELECT content FROM comments WHERE id = 1")->fetch();
   echo $comment['content'];  // Potential XSS 
   ```
   Detection Goal: Evaluate both storage and retrieval points ensuring sanitization and validation.

#### Ensuring Accurate Detection with Minimal False Positives/Negatives:
1. **Context-aware Analysis**:
   - Ensure the analysis understands different HTML contexts (attributes, tags, JS). Misinterpreting content may lead to inaccurate detections.
   - Example:
     ```php
     echo "<input type='text' value='$userInput'>";  // Requires attribute context analysis
     ```

2. **Sanitization Check**:
   - Verify proper usage of functions like `htmlspecialchars`, `htmlentities` for HTML context, and `json_encode` for JSON context.
   - Example:
     ```php
     $cleanInput = htmlspecialchars($userInput, ENT_QUOTES, 'UTF-8');
     echo "<div>$cleanInput</div>";  // Safe
     ```

3. **Common Pitfalls and Edge Cases**:
   - **Improper Escaping Functions**: Sometimes developers may rely on functions that do not adequately sanitize for all contexts.
   - **User Input in Attributes**:
     ```php
     echo "<img src='$url'>";  // Requires different escaping approach
     ```
   - **Encodings and Diffused Payloads**: Detect payloads obfuscated by encoding or using uncommon syntax.
     ```php
     echo "<div>".$userInput."</div>";  // '"><script>alert(1)</script>' in user input can bypass simple regex
     ```

### Common Input Validation Practices:
1. **Validation and Sanitization**:
   - Always validate inputs on both client and server sides. Use white-listing approaches where only known good values are accepted.
   - Example:
     ```php
     if (preg_match('/^[a-zA-Z0-9]+$/', $userInput)) {
         // valid input
     }
     ```

2. **Escaping Outputs**:
   - Use `htmlspecialchars()`, `htmlentities()` for HTML, `addslashes()` for SQL, `json_encode()` for JSON.
   - Example:
     ```php
     $safeInput = htmlspecialchars($userInput, ENT_QUOTES, 'UTF-8');
     ```

3. **Proper Encoding Libraries**:
   - Leverage libraries designed to handle XSS safely (e.g., OWASP’s PHP AntiSamy).
