# Uncontrolled Resource Consumption (CWE-400) in PHP

###### Understanding Uncontrolled Resource Consumption in PHP

**Uncontrolled Resource Consumption** occurs when a web application allows a user to allocate resources (such as memory, CPU, disk space, or network bandwidth) without proper controls, leading to a potential Denial of Service (DoS) condition. In a PHP context, this can manifest through various vectors, such as unbounded memory or storage usage, uncontrolled loops, and external resource fetching without limits.

### Variations and Examples in PHP

#### **1. Uncontrolled Memory Allocation:**

**Example 1: Excessive String Concatenation**
```php
<?php
$id = $_GET['id']; // User input
$data = "Initial Data: ";

for ($i = 0; $i < strlen($id); $i++) {
    $data .= $id; // Uncontrolled concatenation
}
echo $data;
?>
```
**Explanation:**
   - Here, if the `id` parameter is very large, the concatenation inside the loop can consume excessive memory.

**Example 2: File Upload without Size Check**
```php
<?php
if ($_FILES['userfile']['error'] == UPLOAD_ERR_OK) {
    $upload_file = '/var/www/uploads/' . $_FILES['userfile']['name'];
    move_uploaded_file($_FILES['userfile']['tmp_name'], $upload_file);
    echo "File uploaded successfully.";
} else {
    echo "File upload failed.";
}
?>
```
**Explanation:**
   - The above code lacks a check for the file size, potentially allowing users to upload excessively large files, consuming server storage.

#### **2. Uncontrolled Loop Execution:**

**Example 1: Deep Recursion**
```php
<?php
function recursiveFunction($i) {
    if ($i > 0) {
        return recursiveFunction($i - 1); // Uncontrolled recursion
    }
    return $i;
}

$id = intval($_GET['id']);
echo recursiveFunction($id);
?>
```
**Explanation:**
   - A very large value for `id` will cause deep recursion, leading to a stack overflow and potentially crashing the server.

### Guidance for SAST Rule Creation

#### **Understanding the Vulnerability**

To create effective SAST rules for detecting uncontrolled resource consumption in PHP, it is crucial to:
1. Identify common sources of resource allocation (e.g., loops, recursion, memory allocation).
2. Detect patterns where user input directly influences resource-intensive operations.
3. Recognize unsafe functions and operations (e.g., `strlen`, file uploads without size checks, unbounded loops).

#### **Code Examples and Detection Strategies**

**1. Detecting Unbounded Memory Allocation:**
   - **Focus**: Look for concatenations in loops influenced by user input.
   ````php
   <?php
   id = $_GET['id']; // Unsafe user input
   data = "Initial Data: ";
   for (i = 0; i < strlen(id); i++) {
      data .= id;
   }
   echo data;
   ?>
   ````
   - **SAST Rule**: Flag concatenations within loops where the iteration count depends on user input.

**2. Detecting Uncontrolled File Uploads:**
   - **Focus**: Identify file upload routines lacking size checks.
   ```
   <?php
   if ($_FILES['userfile']['error'] == UPLOAD_ERR_OK) {
      $upload_file = '/var/www/uploads/' . $_FILES['userfile']['name'];
      move_uploaded_file($_FILES['userfile']['tmp_name'], $upload_file);
      echo "File uploaded successfully.";
   } else {
      echo "File upload failed.";
   }
   ?>
   ```
   - **SAST Rule**: Flag file upload handlers (functions handling `$_FILES`) where no size check (`$_FILES['userfile']['size']`) is performed.

**3. Detecting Uncontrolled Recursion:**
   - **Focus**: Look for recursive function calls influenced by user input without a base case limiting depth.
   ```
   <?php
   function recursiveFunction($i) {
       if ($i > 0) {
           return recursiveFunction($i - 1);
       }
       return $i;
   }
   $id = intval($_GET['id']);
   echo recursiveFunction($id);
   ?>
   ```
   - **SAST Rule**: Flag recursive function calls where the base case condition may be influenced or determined by user input directly.

#### **Minimizing False Positives and False Negatives**

To create accurate rules:
1. **Contextual Analysis**: Ensure that the SAST tool understands the control flow and data flow context, reducing false positives by differentiating between controlled and uncontrolled input influences.
2. **Type and Range Checking**: Incorporate checks that recognize input validations that safely restrict user inputs.
3. **Sensitive Operations**: Focus on sensitive operations (e.g., loop bounds, memory allocations, file operations) and their dependence on unsanitized/validated inputs.

#### **Common Pitfalls**

1. **Overly Broad Rules**: Avoid generic rules that flag all loops or memory allocations, as they become impractical due to high false positives.
2. **Ignored Context**: Not considering the context where user inputs are sanitized or validated before use.
3. **Performance Impact**: Ensure that rules are optimized to not significantly hamper the performance of the SAST tool.

#### **Defensive Programming Tips**

1. **Sanitize Inputs**: Ensure all user inputs are validated and sanitized.
2. **Limit Resource Allocation**: Implement limits on resource allocations (e.g., maximum file upload sizes).
3. **Code Reviews**: Regular code reviews to identify potential uncontrolled resource consumption patterns.
4. **Use Safe APIs**: Where possible, use APIs and libraries that inherently manage resource allocations safely.

By understanding uncontrolled resource consumption vulnerabilities and incorporating targeted SAST rules, application security engineers can vastly enhance their ability to detect and mitigate these issues in PHP applications, ensuring more robust and resilient codebases    .
