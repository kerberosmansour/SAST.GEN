# Improper Certificate Validation (CWE-295) in PHP

#### Understanding Improper Certificate Validation

Improper Certificate Validation occurs when an application fails to properly validate SSL/TLS certificates. This leaves the application vulnerable to Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks, where an attacker can intercept encrypted communications and potentially tamper with the data.

In PHP, this issue often manifests in cases where SSL/TLS certificate verification is disabled or improperly implemented.

## Variations and Examples in PHP

Improper Certificate Validation can appear in various ways in PHP applications, including but not limited to:

1. **Disabling Peer Verification:**
   Disabling peer verification entirely.
   
   ```php
   $contextOptions = [
       "ssl" => [
           "verify_peer" => false,
           "verify_peer_name" => false,
       ]
   ];
   $context = stream_context_create($contextOptions);
   $file = file_get_contents("https://example.com", false, $context);
   ```

2. **Disabling Hostname Verification:**
   Only disabling hostname verification while allowing peer verification.
   
   ```php
   $contextOptions = [
       "ssl" => [
           "verify_peer" => true,
           "verify_peer_name" => false, // Hostname verification is disabled
       ]
   ];
   $context = stream_context_create($contextOptions);
   $file = file_get_contents("https://example.com", false, $context);
   ```

3. **Using cURL with Disabled Verification:**
   Improperly setting cURL options to ignore SSL peer verification.
   
   ```php
   $ch = curl_init();
   curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_URL, "https://example.com");
   curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER, false); // Dangerous: no peer verification
   $output = curl_exec($ch);
   curl_close($ch);
   ```

4. **Inadequate Error Handling:**
   Proceeding despite certificate validation errors during an HTTPS request.
   
   ```php
   $ch = curl_init();
   curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_URL, "https://example.com");
   curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, 1);
   curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYHOST, 2);
   curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER, true);
   
   $output = curl_exec($ch);
   if (curl_errno($ch)) {
       echo 'Error:' . curl_error($ch); // Simply logging the error without handling it securely continued execution
   }
   curl_close($ch);
   ```

## Guidance for Writing SAST Rules

To create effective SAST (Static Application Security Testing) rules to detect Improper Certificate Validation, consider the following:

### Understanding the Exploitability
- An attacker can impersonate the legitimate HTTPS server and perform a Man-in-the-Middle attack.
- The attacker can intercept, read, and potentially tamper with the data being transmitted between the client and the server.

### Identifying Patterns
Identify common patterns in PHP code where improper SSL/TLS certificate validation might occur. Some of these include:
- Use of `stream_context_create` with `ssl` options.
- Use of `curl_setopt` with `CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER` or `CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYHOST`.
- Error handling patterns where validation errors are logged or ignored.

### Code Examples

#### SAST Detection for `stream_context_create`

- **Source:**
  
  ```php
  $contextOptions = [
      "ssl" => [
          "verify_peer" => false,
          "verify_peer_name" => false,
      ]
  ];
  $context = stream_context_create($contextOptions);
  ```

- **SAST Rule:** Identify `stream_context_create` usages where `verify_peer` or `verify_peer_name` are set to `false`.

#### SAST Detection for `curl_setopt`

- **Source:**
  
  ```php
  $ch = curl_init();
  curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_URL, "https://example.com");
  curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER, false);
  ```
  
- **SAST Rule:** Detect `curl_setopt` with `CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER` or `CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYHOST` set to `false`.

### Pitfalls and Common Edges Cases

- **False Positives:**
  - Valid use cases for disabling SSL/TLS verification in a development environment versus production.
  - Ensure the context of the code (e.g., debug/logging).

- **False Negatives:**
  - Improper validation may be conditional based on user input or configuration settings. Ensure the analysis traverses conditionals and captures dynamic values.

### Common Input Validation

- For inputs related to URL endpoints, ensure the domain matches expected patterns.
- For certificate handling libraries, validate expected inputs such as certificate chains.
- Ensure proper hostname verification and peer verification are always enabled unless securely justified otherwise.

## Summary

By understanding variations in improper certificate validation in PHP and creating SAST rules to identify these patterns, you can effectively detect and mitigate the risks associated with Improper Certificate Validation:
- Match improper SSL/TLS settings in manual configurations.
- Focus on accurately identifying disabled verification flags.
- Ensure detection mechanisms handle code contexts and conditional checks to minimize false positives and false negatives.
