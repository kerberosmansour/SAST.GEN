# Deserialization of Untrusted Data (CWE-502) in PHP

###### Understanding Deserialization of Untrusted Data in PHP

**Deserialization of Untrusted Data** occurs when an application deserializes data that can be manipulated by an attacker, potentially leading to various types of vulnerabilities including remote code execution (RCE), denial of service (DoS), and access control issues. In PHP, the primary function used for deserialization is `unserialize`, which can be dangerous if not handled correctly.

### Examples and Detailed Code Variations

#### Basic Use of `unserialize`
```php
<?php
$data = $_GET['data'];
$object = unserialize($data);
?>
```
In this example, the `unserialize` function is used directly on user-provided input ($_GET['data']). An attacker could craft serialized data to exploit this, potentially leading to RCE or other malicious actions.

#### Framework-Specific Examples

##### Laravel:
In Laravel applications, deserialization issues may be less common due to the use of Eloquent and Query Builder, but they can still occur in the context of job queues and cache.

```php
// Example of insecure deserialization in a Laravel job
class ProcessData implements ShouldQueue
{
    public function handle()
    {
        $data = unserialize($this->job->data);
        // process data ...
    }
}
```
Here, the job data being unserialized directly can be a vulnerability if the job data is not sanitized or validated properly.

##### Symfony:
In Symfony, deserialization issues could appear in routes that accept serialized objects.

```php
use Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\Request;
use Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\Response;

class DefaultController extends Controller
{
    public function index(Request $request): Response
    {
        $data = $request->get('data');
        $object = unserialize($data);
        // handle object ...
        
        return new Response('OK');
    }
}
```
The `unserialize` function here is used on data retrieved from the request, which could be manipulated by an attacker.

### Guidance for Writing SAST Rules to Detect Deserialization of Untrusted Data

#### Steps to Write Effective SAST Rules

1. **Identify Deserialization Points**:
   - Scan for the use of the `unserialize` function in the codebase.
   - Look for user input sources like `$_GET`, `$_POST`, `$_COOKIE`, and data from external APIs.

2. **Contextual Analysis**:
   - Ensure user input is not directly passed to `unserialize`.
   - Check for use in popular frameworks and libraries.

3. **Validate and Sanitize Input**:
   - Introduce checks for sanitization and validation routines ensuring that serialized data is not arbitrarily passed into `unserialize`.
   - Identify safe usage patterns like deserializing data from verified internal sources.

4. **Minimize False Positives**:
   - Exclude cases where `unserialize` is used with predefined, hardcoded strings.
   - Account for any validation and checks already in place preceding the deserialization.

5. **Create Alerts for Unusual Patterns and Edge Cases**:
   - Monitor complex and nested deserialization routines.
   - Check for serialized data flows into sensitive functions and classes known for gadget chains (like system command invocations).

### Example SAST Rule

```regex
<rule>
    <name>Untrusted Deserialization Detection</name>
    <description>Detects deserialization of untrusted data via the unserialize function in PHP.</description>
    <pattern>(unserialize\s*\()([^)]*$_(GET|POST|COOKIE|REQUEST|FILES|SERVER|ENV|DATA|HTTP_RAW_POST_DATA)[^)]*)\)</pattern>
    <confidence>high</confidence>
    <impact>high</impact>
    <valid-severity>high</valid-severity>
</rule>
```

### Common Pitfalls in Writing SAST Rules

1. **Ignoring Context**:
   - Misidentifying safe uses of `unserialize` leads to false positives.
   - SAST tools may trigger on valid uses such as deserializing data from secure configurations or databases.

2. **Overlooking Complex User Input Sources**:
   - Ensure the rule covers all potential user input vectors, including indirect sources such as API responses.

3. **Specific to Frameworks and Libraries**:
   - Tailor SAST rules to consider common frameworks such as Laravel, Symfony, and CMS like WordPress and Drupal.

### Common Input Validation Checks

1. **Whitelisting**:
   - Only allow predefined and expected input formats.
  
2. **Integrity Checks**:
   - Use digital signatures or hashes to validate the integrity of serialized data.

3. **Switch to Safe Alternatives**:
   - Encourage the use of JSON (`json_encode` and `json_decode`), which is safer and less prone to exploitation compared to native serialization.

In conclusion, deserialization of untrusted data is a severe vulnerability in PHP applications that can have catastrophic consequences if not properly detected and mitigated. Writing effective SAST rules involves understanding various contexts and patterns in which `unserialize` is used and ensuring those are appropriately secured or refactored to safer alternatives.
