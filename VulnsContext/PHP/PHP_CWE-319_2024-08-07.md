# Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information (CWE-319) in PHP

###### Understanding Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information

Cleartext transmission of sensitive information refers to sending sensitive data (such as passwords, credit card numbers, and personal information) over a network without encryption. This can allow attackers to intercept and read the data effortlessly. In the context of PHP applications, this can happen through HTTP instead of HTTPS, improperly sending sensitive information via GET parameters, or through insecure email handling.

### Variations and Examples in PHP

1. **Using HTTP instead of HTTPS:**
   - **Manifestation:** Sensitive data sent over plain HTTP can be intercepted by attackers using network-sniffing tools.
   - **Example:**
     ```php
     // Insecure Login Form Submission
     echo '<form action="http://example.com/login.php" method="POST">';
     ```

2. **Sensitive information in URL parameters:**
   - **Manifestation:** Sensitive information passed in URL parameters can be logged in server logs, browser history, and proxy logs, making it easy to extract.
   - **Example:**
     ```php
     // Insecure password reset link
     echo '<a href="http://example.com/reset.php?token=123456">Reset Password</a>';
     ```

3. **Insecure Email Transmission:**
   - **Manifestation:** Emails sent without encryption can be intercepted during transit.
   - **Example:**
     ```php
     // Sending sensitive information via plain email
     $to = 'user@example.com';
     $subject = 'Your new password';
     $message = 'Your new password is: pass1234';
     mail($to, $subject, $message);
     ```

4. **Insecure WebSocket Communication:**
   - **Manifestation:** WebSockets not using WSS (WebSocket Secure) are vulnerable to interception.
   - **Example:**
     ```php
     // Connect to insecure WebSocket
     echo '<script>let socket = new WebSocket("ws://example.com/socket");</script>';
     ```

### SAST Rule Creation Guidance

#### Understanding the Vulnerability

Cleartext transmission of sensitive information can be exploited by attackers using network sniffing tools to perform man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks. The lack of encryption allows them to read and manipulate data in transit. Developers must ensure data is encrypted using protocols like HTTPS for web traffic, SMTPS for email, and WSS for WebSockets.

#### Writing Effective SAST Rules

1. **Detecting HTTP Usage:**
   - **Rule:** Identify form actions or URLs using the `http` scheme for critical functions like login, registration, or sensitive data transfer.
   - **Code Pattern:** `<form action="http://"`
   - **Example Rule:**
     ```json
     {
         "name": "HTTP Scheme Used for Sensitive Operations",
         "pattern": "<form action=\"http://",
         "description": "Forms that handle sensitive information should use HTTPS.",
         "recommended_action": "Replace 'http://' with 'https://'."
     }
     ```

2. **Check for GET Parameters with Sensitive Information:**
   - **Rule:** Identify URLs that pass sensitive information as GET parameters.
   - **Code Pattern:** `$_GET['param']`
   - **Example Rule:**
     ```json
     {
         "name": "Sensitive Information in URL Parameters",
         "pattern": "_GET",
         "description": "Sensitive information should not be passed in URL parameters.",
         "recommended_action": "Use POST method and ensure the parameters are sent in the request body."
     }
     ```

3. **Securing Email Transmission:**
   - **Rule:** Detect usage of `mail()` for sending sensitive information without encryption.
   - **Code Pattern:** `mail($to, $subject, $message)`
   - **Example Rule:**
     ```json
     {
         "name": "Plaintext Email Transmission",
         "pattern": "mail(",
         "description": "Encrypt emails containing sensitive information.",
         "recommended_action": "Use libraries that support encrypted email transmission."
     }
     ```

4. **WebSocket Security Check:**
   - **Rule:** Identify WebSocket connections initiated with the `ws` scheme.
   - **Code Pattern:** `WebSocket("ws://"`
   - **Example Rule:**
     ```json
     {
         "name": "Insecure WebSocket Connection",
         "pattern": "WebSocket(\"ws://",
         "description": "WebSocket connections should use WSS for security.",
         "recommended_action": "Replace 'ws://' with 'wss://'."
     }
     ```

### Minimizing False Positives and Negatives

- **Contextual Analysis:** Differentiate between contexts where plaintext usage is justified (e.g., non-sensitive endpoints).
- **Regular Expressions:** Use regular expressions to identify more complex patterns accurately.
- **Whitelist:** Create whitelist patterns for known safe code and configurations.
- **Dynamic Analysis Combined:** Use dynamic analysis to verify findings and reduce false positives.

### Edge Cases and Pitfalls

- **Mixed Content:** Detect cases where HTTPS pages include HTTP resources, which can still lead to data interception.
- **Hardcoded Credentials or Tokens:** Look for hardcoded sensitive values in code that may be transmitted.
- **Incomplete Configurations:** Ensure server configurations enforce the use of HTTPS and other secure protocols.

### Input Validation Routines

- **Sources and Sinks:** Validate all inputs and outputs, ensuring sensitive data is sanitized before logging, displaying, or transmitting.
- **Security Policies:** Enforce strong security policies, mandating the use of secure transmission methods across all layers of the application.

By following these guidelines, SAST tool authors can create more precise and effective detection rules for detecting cleartext transmission of sensitive information in PHP applications      .
