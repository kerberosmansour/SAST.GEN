# Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) (CWE-352) in PHP

###### Understanding Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

#### What is CSRF?
Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) is a type of attack where a malicious web entity tricks the user’s browser into sending unauthorized requests to a different site where the user is authenticated. The site cannot distinguish between legitimate requests initiated by the user and forged requests from the attacker※【4:0†source】  .

### Variations of CSRF in PHP

CSRF can appear in various forms, often depending on the framework and coding practices used. Here’s how CSRF manifests in different PHP contexts:

1. **Plain PHP:**
```php
// Vulnerable code: no CSRF protection
if ($_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD'] === 'POST') {
    // Process form data
    $username = $_POST['username'];
    $email = $_POST['email'];
    // Perform some action ...
}
```
2. **Laravel:**
   - Laravel uses the `VerifyCsrfToken` middleware to protect against CSRF by default.
   ```php
   // Kernel.php
   protected $middlewareGroups = [
       'web' => [
            // ... other middleware
            \App\Http\Middleware\VerifyCsrfToken::class,
       ],
   ];
   
   // In a Blade template
   <form method="POST" action="/profile">
       @csrf 
       <!-- Equivalent to: <input type="hidden" name="_token" value="{{ csrf_token() }}"> -->
   </form>
   ```

3. **CodeIgniter:**
   - CodeIgniter includes CSRF protection in its configuration.
   ```php
   // application/config/config.php
   $config['csrf_protection'] = TRUE;

   // In a view file
   <input type="hidden" name="<?=$this->security->get_csrf_token_name();?>" value="<?=$this->security->get_csrf_hash();?>">
   ```

### Writing SAST Rules for CSRF Detection

#### 1. Token-Based Protection Validation
**Approach:** Check whether forms performing state-changing operations include a hidden CSRF token field and whether this token is validated on the server side.

**Example Rule in pseudocode:**
```regex
rule detect_missing_csrf_token
  apply to code
pattern
  <form * method="POST" *>
  and not <input type="hidden" * name="_token" *>
```

#### 2. Middleware or Filter Integration
**Approach:** Ensure that CSRF protection middleware or filters are included in the application’s configuration.

**Example Rule in pseudocode:**
```regex
rule missing_csrf_middleware
  apply to frameworks
pattern 1 (Laravel):
  not protected $middlewareGroups = [
       'web' => [
           ( ... )
           \App\Http\Middleware\VerifyCsrfToken::class
       ],
  ];

pattern 2 (CodeIgniter):
  not $config['csrf_protection'] = TRUE;
```

### Minimizing False Positives and False Negatives

1. **Explicit Checks for Form Tokens:**
   - **False Positives**: Sometimes forms are read-only and don’t require protection.
   - **Resolution**: Include context checks to ascertain whether the form performs state-changing operations.

2. **Middleware Presence:**
   - **False Negatives**: The application might have custom implementation outside standard middleware.
   - **Resolution**: Enhance the rule to check for the presence of validation functions/methods related to CSRF token checks.

3. **Edge Cases with Custom Headers:**
   - Custom headers can be used for CSRF protection in AJAX requests. Ensure these headers are also accounted for in detection logic.
   ```php
   // AJAX setup
   $.ajaxSetup({
       headers: {
           'X-CSRF-TOKEN': $('meta[name="csrf-token"]').attr('content')
       }
   });
   ```

### Common Pitfalls
- **Ignoring Stateless APIs:** Ensure to define clear patterns for exclusion when APIs do not interact with sessions.
- **Framework-Specific Configurations:** Different frameworks have distinct include paths and configurations for CSRF protection.

### Conclusion
CSRF vulnerabilities are generally mitigated by including tokens in forms and validating these tokens on the server side. When writing SAST rules:
- Consider the context of each form and endpoint.
- Check for standard and custom implementations of token inclusion and validation.
- Avoid excessive false positives and negatives by focusing on state-changing operations and comprehensive rule patterns.
