# Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection') (CWE-077) in PHP

###### Understanding Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection') in PHP

**Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')** occurs when untrusted input is used to construct shell commands in a way that allows unintended commands to be executed. This often happens when user-supplied data is concatenated with command strings without proper sanitization.

#### Common Attack Patterns in PHP

1. **Basic Command Injection**
    ```php
    <?php
    $userInput = $_GET['input'];
    system("ls $userInput");
    ?>
    ```
    In the above code, if a user provides a malicious input like `; rm -rf /`, it would be appended to the `ls` command, thus executing these unintended commands.

2. **Using `exec`, `passthru`, and `shell_exec` Functions**
    ```php
    <?php
    $userInput = $_GET['input'];
    $output = shell_exec("cat $userInput");
    echo $output;
    ?>
    ```

3. **Using Backticks (``) for Command Execution**
    ```php
    <?php
    $userInput = $_GET['input'];
    $output = `cat $userInput`;
    echo $output;
    ?>
    ```

#### Examples in Different Contexts

1. **Frameworks Example: Laravel**
    ```php
    <?php
    Route::get('/run-command', function () {
        $cmd = request('cmd');
        return shell_exec($cmd);
    });
    ?>
    ```
    Here, though Laravel is a modern framework, misuse of shell commands can lead to vulnerabilities just as in plain PHP.

2. **Using PHP’s `file_put_contents` with Shell Commands**
    ```php
    <?php
    $fileName = $_GET['file'];
    $content = $_GET['content'];
    file_put_contents("/some/path/$fileName", $content);
    system("tar -czf $fileName.tar.gz /some/path/$fileName");
    ?>
    ```
    Here, tainted `$fileName` can result in command injection when it is passed to `system()`.

### Writing SAST Rules for Command Injection Detection

1. **Identify User Inputs (Sources):**
   - `$_GET`, `$_POST`, `$_REQUEST`
   - `file_get_contents('php://input')`

2. **Identify Command Execution Functions (Sinks):**
   - `system()`
   - `exec()`
   - `passthru()`
   - `shell_exec()`
   - Backticks (``)
   - `proc_open()`
   - `popen()`

3. **Patterns to Detect:**
   - Direct concatenation of user input with command strings.
   - User input embedded within command strings without proper sanitization or escaping.

#### Example SAST Rule

Here is a sample pseudocode of a SAST rule for detecting command injection vulnerabilities:

```yaml
rule:
  id: 'php-command-injection'
  description: 'Detect possible command injection in PHP'
  languages: ['php']
  patterns:
    - pattern-either:
        - pattern: |
            <?php
            $... = $_$;
            ... = system("...", $...);
            ?>
        - pattern: |
            <?php
            $... = $_$;
            ... = exec("...", $...);
            ?>
        - pattern: |
            <?php
            $... = $_$;
            ... = shell_exec("...", $...);
            ?>
        - pattern: |
            <?php
            $... = $_$;
            ... = passthru("...", $...);
            ?>
        - pattern: |
            <?php
            $... = $_$;
            ... = `... $...`
            ?>
        - pattern: |
            <?php
            $... = $_$;
            ... = popen("...", $...);
            ?>
        - pattern: |
            <?php
            $... = $_$;
            ... = proc_open("...", ..., $...);
            ?>
  severity: HIGH
```

### Minimizing False Positives and False Negatives

1. **Whitelist Safe Command Usage:**
   - Allow list commands or established patterns where user inputs are appropriately sanitized using functions like `escapeshellarg` or `escapeshellcmd`.

2. **Test for Context Visibility:**
   - Check not only for direct concatenation but also for indirect usage patterns, such as through intermediate variables or functions.

3. **Incorporate Dynamic Analysis:**
   - Combine static analysis (SAST) with dynamic analysis (DAST) tools to validate suspected vulnerabilities during runtime.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - Consider edge cases, such as conditional command execution or concatenation chains, which might not be caught by simpler rules.

### Common Input Validation Routines

1. **Using `escapeshellarg()` and `escapeshellcmd()`**
    ```php
    <?php
    $userInput = $_GET['input'];
    $sanitizedInput = escapeshellarg($userInput);
    system("ls $sanitizedInput");
    ?>
    ```

2. **Implement Positive Server-side Validation**
    ```php
    <?php
    $userInput = $_GET['input'];
    if (preg_match('/^[a-zA-Z0-9]+$/', $userInput)) {
        system("ls " . escapeshellarg($userInput));
    } else {
        echo "Invalid input.";
    }
    ?>
    ```

In conclusion, effective detection and prevention of command injection in PHP require understanding the various contexts in which user input might interact with command execution functions. Writing accurate SAST rules involves covering a broad range of patterns and contexts, ensuring proper sanitization techniques are implemented, and minimizing both false positives and false negatives by validating the detected risks during runtime【4:0†source】  .
