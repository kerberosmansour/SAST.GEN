# Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection') (CWE-089) in PHP

###### Understanding SQL Injection in PHP

**SQL Injection** is a type of security vulnerability that allows an attacker to interfere with the queries that an application makes to its database. It is caused by improperly handled or sanitized user input within SQL queries. In PHP applications, this commonly transpires through form fields, URL parameters, cookies, or other user-supplied data.

### Variations of SQL Injection in PHP

SQL Injection can appear in different forms and contexts in PHP applications, such as direct execution of SQL statements, dynamic queries in frameworks, or even ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) libraries. Here are some common variations:

1. **Direct Execution**: Using PHP's `mysqli` or `PDO` functions to run queries.
2. **Framework-Specific**: Utilizing ORM query methods (e.g., Laravel Eloquent, Symfony Doctrine).
3. **Blind SQL Injection**: When the application doesn't show query errors, but allows logical operations that affect the response time or result set size.
4. **Stored Procedures and Dynamic SQL**: Creating and executing SQL dynamically within stored procedures.

### Code Examples Illustrating SQL Injection

#### Direct Execution with `mysqli`

**Vulnerable Example**:
```php
$conn = new mysqli("localhost", "user", "password", "database");

$id = $_GET['id'];
$sql = "SELECT name, email FROM users WHERE id = $id";
$result = $conn->query($sql);
```

Here, the `$id` parameter can be manipulated to alter the query logic, leading to SQL injection.

#### Using `PDO` with Parameter Binding

**Secure Example**:
```php
$dbh = new PDO('mysql:host=localhost;dbname=database', $user, $pass);
$id = $_GET['id'];
$stmt = $dbh->prepare('SELECT name, email FROM users WHERE id = :id');
$stmt->bindParam(':id', $id, PDO::PARAM_INT);
$stmt->execute();
```

Binding parameters ensures that inputs are treated as literals, preventing injection.

### Guidance for Writing SAST Rules

To effectively create SAST (Static Application Security Testing) rules for SQL injection detection in PHP, consider the following key points:

1. **Data Flow Analysis**: Track user input from sources (e.g., `$_GET`, `$_POST`, `$_COOKIE`) to database queries.
2. **Pattern Matching**: Identify common SQL patterns in code strings and flag concatenation operations.
3. **Context Awareness**: Recognize contexts where escaping doesn't suffice (e.g., structure names like table or column names).
4. **Framework Behaviors**: Account for how different PHP frameworks and libraries handle SQL injections, considering their API nuances.

### Examples for Detection Rules

#### Direct SQL Queries

**Pattern**:
- Detect queries with direct variable inclusion:
  ```php
  $query = "SELECT * FROM table WHERE column = " . $user_input;
  ```
- Look for `mysqli_query()`, `PDO->query()` calls with concatenated strings.

#### ORM and Framework-Specific Queries

**Pattern**:
- In Laravel's Eloquent ORM, dynamically built queries:
  ```php
  $user = DB::select("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = $id");
  ```
- Detect use of raw SQL within ORM methods.

### Minimizing False Positives and False Negatives

To minimize false positives:
1. **Contextual Analysis**: Ensure the rule understands the context where user inputs are safe (e.g., adequately parameterized queries).
2. **Heuristics**: Employ heuristics to differentiate between dynamic content meant for user display versus query construction.

To minimize false negatives:
1. **Comprehensive Patterns**: Cover diverse SQL injection patterns, including indirect data flow (e.g., user input stored in a variable and later concatenated into a query).
2. **Regular Updates**: Regularly update rules to account for new types of injection vectors and evolving framework APIs.

### Common Pitfalls in Rule Writing

1. **Ignoring Escaping Limitations**: Just escaping user input isn't always enough; structural query elements should never be sourced from user input.
2. **Over-Reliance on Specific APIs**: Rules focused too narrowly on specific functions (`mysqli_query`) may miss injections through other methods (e.g., ORM).

### Defensive Coding Practices

Even beyond writing SAST rules, developers should adhere to robust defensive coding practices, such as:
1. **Using Prepared Statements**: Always prefer prepared statements with bound parameters over direct query construction.
2. **Sanitizing Inputs**: Implement whitelist validation and sanitize all inputs rigorously.

By merging these insights into SAST tools, you can enhance the accuracy of detecting SQL injection vulnerabilities in PHP applications while ensuring comprehensive coverage across different coding practices and frameworks.
