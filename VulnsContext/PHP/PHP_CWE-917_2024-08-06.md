# Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an Expression Language Statement ('Expression Language Injection') (CWE-917) in PHP

###### Understanding Expression Language Injection

Expression Language (EL) injection, specifically in PHP, involves exploiting user data that is improperly neutralized within an Expression Language statement. This can lead to arbitrary code execution, thereby compromising the security of the application. Here's how it typically manifests:

- **User-supplied data is embedded in expression statements without proper sanitization or escaping.**
- **This data can then manipulate the logic of the expression to perform unintended actions.**

### Variations of Improper Neutralization in PHP

EL injection can present itself in various ways, including but not limited to:

1. **Direct Injection in Template Engines**: 
   Many PHP frameworks use template engines like Smarty or Twig, and if user input is directly embedded in templates, it can lead to EL injection.

    **Example (Twig Template Engine):**
    ```php
    $loader = new \Twig\Loader\ArrayLoader([
        'index' => 'Hello {{ name }}!'
    ]);
    $twig = new \Twig\Environment($loader);

    echo $twig->render('index', ['name' => $_GET['name']]);
    ```
    Here, if `$_GET['name']` is not sanitized, an attacker could manipulate it to inject malicious code.

2. **Dynamic Expressions in Templating**:
   **Example:**
   ```php
   $template->assign('userInput', $_GET['input']);
   $template->display('template.tpl');
   ```
   If `$_GET['input']` is "}}{% print(system('id')) %}{{", the engine might execute `system('id')`.

3. **Improper Validation in PHP Interpreters**:
   **Example:**
   ```php
   $code = 'return ' . $_GET['expression'] . ';';
   eval($code);
   ```
   If `$_GET['expression']` is "phpinfo()", it executes `phpinfo()` displaying sensitive information.

### Guidance for Writing Effective SAST Rules

To create effective SAST rules to detect such injections, you must understand both the context and how these injections typically occur in PHP codebases. Here’s a structured approach:

#### Identify Potentially Dangerous Functions
1. **Template Rendering Functions**: Twig, Smarty, Blade
   - Check if user inputs are directly passed into these functions.
   
2. **Evaluation Functions**: `eval()`, `create_function()`
   - Detect instances where user input is concatenated into evaluated code strings.

#### Code Examples and Detection Logic

1. **Template Engines**:
   - **Search for template assignments and renders involving user inputs:**
   ```php
   // Example in Twig
   if (preg_match('/\$twig->render\(\s*\'\w+\'\s*,\s*\[\s*\'\w+\'\s*=>\s*\$_(GET|POST|REQUEST)\[\w+\]\s*\]\)/', $fileContent)) {
       // Flag it
   }
   ```
  
2. **Use of `eval`**:
   - **Search for usage of `eval` with user input:**
   ```php
   if (preg_match('/eval\(\s*(\'|"|\s*)\.\s*$_(GET|POST|REQUEST)\[\w+\]\s*\.?\s*(\'|"|\s*)\)/', $fileContent)) {
       // Flag it
   }
   ```
  
3. **General Protective Measures**:
   - Ensure any user inputs are subjected to rigorous input validation and sanitization before being embedded within expressions or executed as code.

#### Reducing False Positives and False Negatives
- **Contextual Analysis**: Ensure the SAST tool performs contextual analysis rather than simple pattern matching. For example, distinguish between static strings and dynamic variables when evaluating safety.
- **Whitelist Safe Functions**: Identify and whitelist safe usage patterns and functions to avoid false positives. 

#### Common Pitfalls When Writing Detection Rules
1. Over-reliance on Regex: Complex patterns might require more sophisticated parsing and Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) analysis.
2. Ignoring Framework-Specific Contexts: Different frameworks have different templating syntaxes and safe APIs; rules must be tailored for each.
3. Not Considering Data Flow: It's crucial to track the data flow from sources (user inputs) to sinks (execution points) accurately.

### Conclusion

Writing robust SAST rules for detecting Expression Language Injection in PHP requires a comprehensive understanding of how this vulnerability manifests, proper analysis of contexts in code, and careful rule crafting to minimize false positives and negatives【4:0†source】【4:5†source】.
