# Uncontrolled Search Path Element (CWE-427) in PHP

###### Understanding Uncontrolled Search Path Element in PHP

#### What is Uncontrolled Search Path Element?

**Uncontrolled Search Path Element**, also known as CWE-427, occurs when a program uses a search path that includes directories controlled by an attacker. This vulnerability allows an attacker to modify the search path and the elements within it so that the system executes malicious code instead of the legitimate code.

In PHP applications, this vulnerability can occur in various ways, especially when dealing with the inclusion of files or execution of system commands.

### Variations in PHP Applications and Frameworks

#### Basic Example in PHP

1. **Direct Inclusion Vulnerability**:
    ```php
    <?php
    $page = $_GET['page'];
    include("pages/" . $page);
    ?>
    ```
    This code is vulnerable because an attacker can control the `$page` variable via user input and include arbitrary files, potentially executing malicious code.

2. **PATH Environment Variable**:
    ```php
    putenv("PATH=/tmp/malicious_dir:".getenv("PATH"));
    echo shell_exec("ls");
    ```
    The above modifies the `PATH` environment variable to include a directory controlled by an attacker, making it possible for malicious binaries to be executed.

#### Context-Specific Examples

1. **File Inclusion in CMS Frameworks (like WordPress)**:
    ```php
    include(plugin_dir_path(__FILE__) . $_GET['page'] . '.php');
    ```
    In this example, an attacker could control the `page` parameter to include files outside of intended directories.

2. **Common Libraries (like Composer)**:
    - Using `require` and `require_once` with user-controlled input:
    ```php
    $lib = $_GET['lib'];
    require("libraries/" . $lib . ".php");
    ```

### Guidelines for Writing Effective SAST Rules

#### Understanding the Vulnerability

- **CWE-ID**: 427
- **Common Attack Vector**:
    - Inclusion or requirement of files based on user input.
    - Modification of environment variables that control search paths.
    - Execution of system commands where the search path might include directories with attacker-controlled binaries.
- **Exploitation**:
    - Attacker places a malicious file in a directory that is part of the search path.
    - Attacker crafts a user input to trigger the inclusion of the malicious file.

#### Practical Detection Rules

When writing SAST rules to identify Uncontrolled Search Path Elements in PHP, consider the following:

1. **Detecting File Inclusion Based on User Input**:
    - **Rule**: Flag instances where user-controlled data is concatenated with a file path in `include`, `require`, `include_once`, `require_once`.
    - **Example**:
        ```php
        include($_GET['page'] . ".php");
        ```

2. **Detecting Environment Variable Manipulation**:
    - **Rule**: Detect usage of `putenv`, `getenv` with user-supplied values.
    - **Example**:
        ```php
        putenv("PATH=" . $_GET['path']);
        ```

3. **Detecting Use of `exec`, `shell_exec`, `system`, `passthru`**:
    - **Rule**: Flag instances where these functions are used with user-supplied input.
    - **Example**:
        ```php
        $output = shell_exec($_GET['command']);
        ```

#### Minimizing False Positives/Negatives

- **Whitelist Known Safe Operations**:
    - Certain paths or files may be known to be safe; adding them to a whitelist can reduce false positives.
  
- **Check for Sanitization**:
    - Ensure user input is properly sanitized or validated before use, particularly when involving file paths or command executions.
    - Example of proper validation:
        ```php
        $allowed_pages = ["home", "about", "contact"];
        if (in_array($_GET['page'], $allowed_pages)) {
            include($_GET['page'] . ".php");
        }
        ```

- **Edge Cases**:
    - The SAST tool should analyze both direct and indirect assignments, e.g., variables populated via functions that might contain user data.
    - Multiple layers of function calls and parameter passing should be unwrapped to examine the source of the data.

### Common Pitfalls

- **Neglecting Indirect Assignments**:
    - Variables might be assigned values through several function calls or conditional statements, making it harder to track the source of the data.
    - Use taint analysis to trace data flow from the source to the sink.

- **Underestimating Environment Variables**:
    - Changes to the environment variables can sometimes be overlooked in static analysis.
    - Ensure the SAST tool can trace modifications to these variables and their usage context.

### Example Code Snippets for Rule Testing

#### Valid Vulnerable Code Example:
```php
<?php
$page = $_GET['page'];
include("/trusted_path/" . $page);
putenv("PATH=/untrusted_path:" . getenv("PATH"));
$output = shell_exec($_GET['command']);
?>
```

#### Corrected Secure Code Example:
```php
<?php
$allowed_pages = ["home", "about", "contact"];
$page = $_GET['page'];

if (in_array($page, $allowed_pages)) {
    include("/trusted_path/" . $page . ".php");
}

$output = shell_exec('ls');
?>
```

By following these guidelines, the SAST rules can be crafted to effectively detect instances of Uncontrolled Search Path Element vulnerabilities while reducing the chances of both false positives and false negatives, ensuring a robust application security stance.
