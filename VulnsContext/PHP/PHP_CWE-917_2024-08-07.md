# Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an Expression Language Statement ('Expression Language Injection') (CWE-917) in PHP

###### Understanding Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an Expression Language Statement ('Expression Language Injection'):

Expression Language Injection (EL Injection) occurs when user-supplied data is unsafely included in the expression language statements of an application. This can lead to the execution of arbitrary code or manipulation of server-side objects, resulting in severe security vulnerabilities.

### Variations and Examples:

#### Example in Vanilla PHP:

```php
<?php
    $expression = $_GET['expression'];
    eval("echo $expression;");
?>
```

In this example, user input is directly evaluated within an `eval` statement, which is highly dangerous if not properly sanitized.

#### Example in a PHP Framework (e.g., Laravel):

Laravel utilizes Blade for templating. While Blade is designed to be safe, improper handling can still lead to vulnerabilities.

```php
{{ $userInput }}
```

If `{{ }}` is used directly without escaping user input, it can lead to code injection if the input contains valid Blade directives.

#### Example in a CMS (e.g., WordPress):

WordPress uses PHP functions to render content dynamically, and improper handling of user-supplied data can result in EL Injection.

```php
<?php echo do_shortcode($_POST['shortcode']); ?>
```

This code executes any shortcode passed through the `$_POST` request, allowing for potential execution of arbitrary PHP code.

### Guidance for Writing SAST Rules:

#### Detecting EL Injection Vulnerabilities:

##### Step-by-step Detection Process:

1. **Identify Sink Functions**:
   - Identify common PHP functions and Expression Language constructs that can evaluate or execute code, such as `eval()`, `assert()`, `preg_replace()` with the `e` modifier, etc.

2. **Identify Source of User Input**:
   - Common sources include `$_GET`, `$_POST`, `$_REQUEST`, etc.

3. **Ensure Proper Neutralization**:
   - Check if user input is properly sanitized, validated, and neutralized before being passed to sink functions.

##### Example Rule Pseudocode for Detecting Unsecured `eval` Statements:

```
IF
    function_call == 'eval'
    AND parameter_contains(user_input)
    AND !sanitize_function_called_with(user_input)
THEN
    raise_alert("Potential Expression Language Injection")
```

##### Code Example to Detect:

```php
<?php
    $expression = $_GET['expression'];
    eval("echo $expression;"); // Alert: Potential EL Injection
?>
```

#### Reducing False Positives and False Negatives:

1. **False Positives**:
   - Ensure that the SAST tool checks for the absence of sanitization functions like `htmlspecialchars()`, `strip_tags()`, and proper input validation.
   - Context-aware analysis helps in distinguishing between code that safely uses user input and code that potentially leads to EL injection.

2. **False Negatives**:
   - Comprehensive source and sink analysis.
   - Cover different contexts and not just direct function calls. For example, input passed through several functions before reaching the sink.

### Common Pitfalls and Edge Cases:

- **Complex Data Flows**: Ensure the tool can track variables through different scopes and functions.
- **Embedded Expressions**: Some applications use nested expressions or custom templating engines which might not be directly analyzable through simple patterns.
- **Framework-Specific Conventions**: Different frameworks have their own methods and conventions that require tailored rules.

### Input Validation and Mitigation Strategies:

- **Positive Input Validation**: Only allow known safe values (whitelisting).
- **Output Escaping**: Employ functions like `htmlspecialchars()` to prevent the inclusion of HTML and script tags.
- **Use of Secure APIs**: Where possible, avoid direct eval-like functions and use safer alternatives or API bindings.

By following these guidelines, developing precise and effective SAST detection rules for EL Injection in PHP applications can be achieved, mitigating the risk of false positives and false negatives while ensuring comprehensive coverage of injection points【4:0†source】【4:3†source】【4:12†source】【4:13†source】.
