# Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following') (CWE-059) in Kotlin

###### Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following') - Detailed Explanation

**Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')** is a security vulnerability that arises when an application follows links or resolves file paths unsafely, allowing an attacker to influence the link resolution process in a way that accesses unintended files or directories【4:0†source】.

This weakness is categorized under Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) ID 59, indicating the improper control over the resolution of filesystem links before accessing files. Such improper resolution may lead to unauthorized access to sensitive files, data leakage, privilege escalation, or other malicious activities.

### Understanding the Vulnerability
This vulnerability typically occurs when:

1. **File System Links**: The application follows symbolic links (symlinks) or hard links without proper validation.
2. **Directory Traversal**: Manipulating directory paths to access restricted directories/files outside the intended directory.
3. **Symlink Race**: During TOCTOU (Time of Check to Time of Use) race conditions, where the link's target changes between validation and access.

### Exploiting the Vulnerability
An attacker might exploit this vulnerability to:

- By-pass security mechanisms.
- Access or modify sensitive files.
- Create or delete files unauthorizedly.

### Examples in Kotlin with Popular Frameworks

To help the author of a SAST tool to write detection rules, below are several examples illustrating how this vulnerability might be introduced in Kotlin using different frameworks.

#### 1. Plain Kotlin - File Access
Example where a symbolic link can be exploited.

```kotlin
import java.io.File

fun readFile(filePath: String): String {
    val file = File(filePath)
    return file.readText()
}

// Usage
val userInput = "../../etc/passwd" // Potential malicious input
println(readFile(userInput))
```

**Potential SAST Rule:** Detect any instances of `File` object creation followed by read/write operations without path validation.

#### 2. Spring Boot - File Upload
Using Spring's file upload feature to exploit symbolic links.

```kotlin
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.PostMapping
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestParam
import org.springframework.web.multipart.MultipartFile

@PostMapping("/upload")
fun uploadFile(@RequestParam("file") file: MultipartFile) {
    val destination = File("/uploads/" + file.originalFilename!!)
    file.transferTo(destination)
}
```

**Potential SAST Rule:** Identify multipart file transfer operations (`transferTo`) performed without canonical path checks.

#### 3. Ktor Framework - File Download
Ktor server handlers vulnerable to path traversal.

```kotlin
import io.ktor.application.*
import io.ktor.response.*
import io.ktor.routing.*
import io.ktor.http.*
import io.ktor.server.engine.embeddedServer
import io.ktor.server.netty.Netty

fun main() {
    embeddedServer(Netty, port = 8080) {
        routing {
            get("/download/{fileName}") {
                val fileName = call.parameters["fileName"]
                val file = File("uploads/$fileName")
                if (file.exists()) {
                    call.respondFile(file)
                } else {
                    call.respond(HttpStatusCode.NotFound)
                }
            }
        }
    }.start(wait = true)
}
```

**Potential SAST Rule:** Locate file operations based on user input parameters within file-handling routes.

### Recommendations for Rule Authoring
When crafting SAST rules for detecting ‘Improper Link Resolution Before File Access’, ensure:

1. **False Positives Minimization**:
    - Ensure the rule checks for both validation and sanitized handling of file paths.
    - Check for the use of methods like `File.getCanonicalPath()` to ensure that all intermediate components of the file path are valid.

2. **High False Negative Rates**:
    - Track tainted data (like user inputs) from their source all the way to the file operation APIs.
    - Handle all types of input validation: whitelist-based validation rather than blacklists.

### Summary
Improper link resolution before file access in Kotlin, particularly within popular frameworks like Spring Boot and Ktor, requires close inspection of file handling operations that may be influenced by user input. By detecting unsafe file operations and ensuring path sanitization, a SAST tool can effectively minimize the risk associated with this vulnerability.
