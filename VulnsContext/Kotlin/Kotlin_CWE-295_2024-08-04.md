# Improper Certificate Validation (CWE-295) in Kotlin

###### Explanation of Improper Certificate Validation

Improper Certificate Validation (CWE-295) refers to instances where an application does not properly check or validate the SSL/TLS certificates that are used to establish secure connections, such as HTTPS. This failure can allow attackers to carry out man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks, gaining access to, or altering, data during transmission.

Key causes and manifestations of improper certificate validation include:
1. **Failure to Validate Certificates**: Not performing any validation at all.
2. **Ignoring Validation Errors**: Ignoring errors that arise during validation.
3. **Disregarding Hostname Verification**: Not ensuring that the hostname in the URL matches the hostname in the certificate.
4. **Trusting All Certificates**: Trusting any certificate, even those that are self-signed or otherwise untrusted.
5. **Weak Validation Logic**: Using simplistic or flawed logic that doesnâ€™t fully verify certificate properties.

### Common Ways Improper Certificate Validation Appears in Kotlin and Popular Frameworks

1. **Ignoring SSL Certificate Validation in `HttpClient`**:
   ```kotlin
   val client = HttpClient(CIO) {
       engine {
           https {
               trustManager = TrustAllTrustManager
           }
       }
   }
   ```
   In this instance, the `TrustAllTrustManager` blindly trusts any SSL certificate, making the connection susceptible to MITM attacks.

2. **Disabling SSL Validation in OkHttp**:
   ```kotlin
   val client = OkHttpClient.Builder()
       .hostnameVerifier { _, _ -> true }
       .sslSocketFactory(getUnsafeSSLSocketFactory(), getTrustAllCertsManager())
       .build()
   ```

3. **Accepting All Certificates in Apache HttpClient**:
   ```kotlin
   val sslContext = SSLContext.getInstance("TLS")
   sslContext.init(null, arrayOf<TrustManager>(INSECURE_TRUST_MANAGER), SecureRandom())
   
   val client = HttpClients.custom()
       .setSSLContext(sslContext)
       .setSSLHostnameVerifier(NoopHostnameVerifier.INSTANCE)
       .build()
   ```

4. **Retrofit with OkHttp ignoring SSL Validation**:
   ```kotlin
   val client = OkHttpClient.Builder()
       .hostnameVerifier { _, _ -> true }
       .sslSocketFactory(getUnsafeSSLSocketFactory(), getTrustAllCertsManager())
       .build()

   val retrofit = Retrofit.Builder()
       .client(client)
       .baseUrl("https://example.com")
       .build()
   ```

5. **Disabling `SSLSocketFactory` verification in Java/Kotlin**:
   ```kotlin
   val context = SSLContext.getInstance("TLS")
   context.init(null, arrayOf<TrustManager>(INSECURE_TRUST_MANAGER), SecureRandom())
   
   val socketFactory = context.socketFactory
   val socket = socketFactory.createSocket(InetSocketAddress("example.com", 443), 0)
   ```

6. **Bypassing verification in AWS SDK**:
   ```kotlin
   val clientConfig = ClientConfiguration()
   clientConfig.isProtocolHQIsSecure = false  // Incorrectly configured to ignore HTTPS
   
   val awsClient = AmazonS3Client.builder()
       .withClientConfiguration(clientConfig)
       .build()
   ```

### High-Quality SAST Rules to Detect Improper Certificate Validation
When writing Static Application Security Testing (SAST) rules to detect improper certificate validation in Kotlin, implement checks for:

1. **Custom TrustManager Implementation**: Ensure custom `TrustManager` classes do not bypass certificate validation.
2. **HTTP Client Configuration**: Flag configurations where SSL/TLS certificate validation is disabled or bypassed (e.g., using `OkHttp`, `Retrofit`, `HttpClient`, and `Apache HttpClient`).
3. **Hostname Verifiers**: Verify that configured hostname verifiers do proper wildcard or exact matching.
4. **Usage of `SSLSocketFactory`**: Ensure usages of `SSLSocketFactory` do not bypass standard verification flows.
5. **AWS SDK Configuration**: Ensure AWS SDK configurations force secure transmissions.

Example SAST Rule Pseudocode:
```graphql
rule "Improper Certificate Validation" {
    description: "Detects configurations that disable or bypass SSL/TLS certificate validation"
    match {
        kotlin {
            function-call pattern  {
                name = "OkHttpClient.Builder.hostnameVerifier";
                args = ["* -> true"] 
            };
            // Other similar patterns for different frameworks
        }
    }
    output : "Potential improper certificate validation detected"
}
```

A thorough understanding and pertinent configurations of these SAST rules ensure they account for different variations of the vulnerability while minimizing false positives and negatives, providing effective and actionable results.
