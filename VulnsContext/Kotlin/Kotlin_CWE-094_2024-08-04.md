# Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection') (CWE-094) in Kotlin

#### Explanation of Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection') for SAST Detection Rules

**Definition and Impact:**
Improper Control of Generation of Code, also known as Code Injection, occurs when an application generates and executes code from user input without adequate validation, filtering, or sanitization. This can result in unauthorized code execution, potentially giving an attacker complete control over the affected system【4:0†source】【4:1†source】.

### Common Injection Points:
1. **User-supplied data used to construct scripts or dynamic evaluations.**
2. **Insufficient validation or sanitization of inputs before they are used in code statements.**
3. **Use of non-parameterized or dynamic code generation techniques that directly incorporate user inputs.**

## Variations of Code Injection in Kotlin and Popular Frameworks

### 1. **General Kotlin Code Injection:**
Kotlin, while being a type-safe language, can still be vulnerable to code injection through reflection or script execution:
   
**Example:**
```kotlin
val input = readLine()!!
val result = kotlin.script.experimental.jvm.util.KotlinJsr223JvmLocalScriptEngineFactory()
            .scriptEngine.eval(input)
println(result)
```
**Explanation:** Here, arbitrary user input is evaluated as a Kotlin script, which can execute any hostile code provided by an attacker.

### 2. **Spring Framework with Kotlin:**

**Example:**
```kotlin
@PostMapping("/execute")
fun executeCode(@RequestParam code: String): ResponseEntity<String> {
    val engine = ScriptEngineManager().getEngineByName("kotlin")
    val result = engine.eval(code)  // Code injection vulnerability
    return ResponseEntity.ok(result.toString())
}
```
**Explanation:** This example takes user input as a script and evaluates it without sanitization, allowing for execution of arbitrary code.

### 3. **Exposed Framework:**
[Exposed](https://github.com/JetBrains/Exposed) is a popular Kotlin SQL library that can be misused to dynamically execute malicious SQL commands:

**Example:**
```kotlin
transaction {
    val input = call.parameters["query"]
    exec(input)  // SQL injection vulnerability
}
```
**Explanation:** Directly executing user-provided SQL commands without sanitization can lead to SQL injection, a subset of code injection vulnerabilities.

### 4. **Ktor Framework:**

**Example:**
```kotlin
post("/exec") {
    val input = call.receive<String>()
    val result = eval(input) // Code injection vulnerability
    call.respondText(result.toString())
}
```
**Explanation:** Here, user input is directly evaluated, enabling the execution of arbitrary Kotlin code.

### SAST Rules and Considerations:

**Detection Rules for SAST:**
1. **Identify Dynamic Evaluation Patterns:**
   - Flag the use of eval-like functions (`ScriptEngine.eval()`, `kotlin.script.experimental.jvm.util.KotlinJsr223JvmLocalScriptEngineFactory`)
   - Identify usages where user input is directly passed to these functions.

2. **User-Provided Data in Commands:**
   - Flag methods such as `exec()`, `createQuery()`, and `transaction()` when they concatenate or include user-supplied data.

3. **Reflection and Scripting APIs:**
   - Flag reflection API usages where the class/method names or parameters are derived from user inputs.

**Example Rule for eval():**
```regex
(eval\s*\(\s*[^\)]*\) \S*from \S*input)
```
**Explanation:** This regex detects the presence of `eval` where the parameters are derived from inputs, highlighting potential hazards.

**Example Rule for ScriptEngine:**
```regex
(ScriptEngineManager\(\)\.getEngineByName\("kotlin"\)\.eval\(\S*input)
```
**Explanation:** This identifies `ScriptEngineManager` and `eval` initializations with parameters that could include user data.

## Conclusion:
Implementing accurate and effective static analysis rules to identify improper control of code generation in Kotlin requires a focus on reflection, dynamic scripting, and unsafe user input handling. Ensuring that these vectors are properly sanitized and validated can significantly reduce the risk of code injection vulnerabilities.
