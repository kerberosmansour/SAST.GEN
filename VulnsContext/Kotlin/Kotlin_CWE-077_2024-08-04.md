# Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection') (CWE-077) in Kotlin

ImproImproper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command (commonly known as Command Injection) occurs when software that constructs a system command using data controlled by an external actor does not properly neutralize or sanitize the input. This allows an attacker to manipulate the command in a malicious way.

### Explanation of Command Injection
Command injection vulnerabilities typically exploit insufficient input validation and improper escaping of input characters in commands executed by the host. When an application takes user input and constructs an OS command, if it does not properly sanitize this input, an attacker can inject additional commands or modify the intended ones.

For instance, consider the following example:
```shell
String command = "echo " + userInput;
```
If `userInput` is controlled by an attacker and is set to `hello; rm -rf /`, the resulting command becomes:
```shell
echo hello; rm -rf /
```
Executing this command would result in both `echo hello` and the deletion of the root directory.

### Variations in Kotlin
Kotlin, although a type-safe language, can still be vulnerable to command injection when interacting with system commands, especially without proper sanitization or validation of inputs.

1. **Basic Command Execution in Kotlin:**
   ```kotlin
   val runtime = Runtime.getRuntime()
   val process = runtime.exec("sh -c 'echo ${userInput}'")
   process.waitFor()
   ```
   In this example, if `userInput` contains malicious characters, e.g., `hello; rm -rf /`, it will execute `rm -rf /`.

2. **Using `ProcessBuilder`:**
   ```kotlin
   val pb = ProcessBuilder("sh", "-c", "echo ${userInput}")
   pb.start()
   ```
   Command injection can occur here too, as the `userInput` is directly integrated into the command string.

3. **Popular Framework Variations:**

   - **Ktor Framework Example:**
     ```kotlin
     post("/execute") {
       val params = call.receiveParameters()
       val cmd = params["cmd"]
       val process = Runtime.getRuntime().exec(cmd)
       call.respondText("Command executed: $cmd")
     }
     ```
     In this Ktor example, if an attacker sends `cmd=echo; rm -rf /`, it will execute both `echo` and `rm -rf /`.

   - **Spring Boot Kotlin Example:**
     ```kotlin
     @PostMapping("/run")
     fun runCommand(@RequestParam cmd: String): String {
       val process = Runtime.getRuntime().exec(cmd)
       process.waitFor()
       return "Command \"$cmd\" executed."
     }
     ```
     Similar to the previous examples, untrusted input can lead to disastrous outcomes.

### SAST Rule Detection Strategy
For writing an effective SAST rule to detect command injection in Kotlin, the following strategies should be used to minimize false negatives and false positives:

1. **Pattern Matching on Command Execution Functions:**
   - Look for `Runtime.getRuntime().exec()`, `ProcessBuilder`, and other command execution methods.
   - Ensure the pattern includes commands constructed using user inputs.

2. **Taint Analysis:**
   - Track data flow from input sources (e.g., HTTP parameters, user inputs) to command execution points.
   - Check if there are sanitization or validation steps before the command execution.

3. **Heuristics:**
   - Check for concatenation of user inputs into command strings.
   - Flag usages of shell constructs like `&&`, `;`, `|`, `&` within the command strings which are potential red flags.

### Examples for SAST Rule:
- Detect unvalidated user inputs within command execution contexts:
  ```regex
  Runtime\.getRuntime\(\)\.exec\(\s*\".*\$\{.*\}\s*\".*\)
  ProcessBuilder\(.*\"sh\",.*\"-c\",.*\$\{.*\}.*\).*start\(\)
  ```
- Flag common pitfalls in frameworks:
  ```regex
  fun\s+runCommand.*\(@RequestParam\s+.*\)
  ```

By focusing on common patterns and using taint analysis, SAST tools can effectively detect instances of command injection while minimizing false positives   .
