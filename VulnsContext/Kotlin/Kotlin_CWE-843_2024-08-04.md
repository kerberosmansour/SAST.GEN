# Access of Resource Using Incompatible Type ('Type Confusion') (CWE-843) in Kotlin

#### Explanation of Access of Resource Using Incompatible Type ('Type Confusion')

Access of Resource Using Incompatible Type (commonly known as 'Type Confusion') occurs when a resource (such as a variable, object, or data structure) is accessed using an incompatible type. This can lead to critical vulnerabilities, such as arbitrary code execution, memory corruption, or the exposure of sensitive information. The fundamental risk associated with Type Confusion is that it disrupts the assumed type-safety of the code.

### How Type Confusion Occurs

1. **Improper Type Casting**: When an object of one type is cast to another type without proper validation.
2. **Inconsistent Type Identification**: During serialization/deserialization processes, data might be interpreted as a different type.
3. **Memory Corruption**: Errors in memory management (like buffer overflows) can result in data being accessed as a different type.
4. **Interfacing with Native Code**: When high-level languages interface with low-level code, type consistency must be strictly enforced, otherwise type confusion can arise.

### Type Confusion in Kotlin

As a modern language running on JVM, Kotlin is statically typed and leverages Java's extensive library ecosystem and memory model, inheriting both its strengths and potential vulnerabilities.

#### Examples and Variations in Kotlin (Different Frameworks)

1. **Using Reflection with Incompatible Types**:
   Kotlin can use Java reflection which might lead to type confusion if types are not correctly checked:

   ```kotlin
   import kotlin.reflect.full.memberProperties

   open class Animal(val name: String)
   class Dog(name: String, val breed: String): Animal(name)

   fun main() {
       val animal = Animal("SomeAnimal")
       val dog = animal as Dog  // Type confusion error here
       println(dog.breed)
   }
   ```

2. **Serialization and Deserialization Issues**:
   Using libraries like Jackson or GSON in Kotlin - improper type handling can lead to type confusion:

   ```kotlin
   import com.fasterxml.jackson.module.kotlin.jacksonObjectMapper
   import com.fasterxml.jackson.module.kotlin.readValue

   open class Animal(val name: String)
   class Dog(name: String, val breed: String): Animal(name)

   fun main() {
       val data = """{"name": "Rex", "breed": "Labrador"}"""
       val mapper = jacksonObjectMapper()
       val animal: Animal = mapper.readValue(data)  // If treated as Animal but actual object is Dog, type confusion might occur
       println((animal as Dog).breed)  // Unsafe cast might cause runtime error
   }
   ```

3. **Unsafe Casting in Collections**:
   When collections use generics, incorrectly casting or adding incompatible types might lead to type confusion:

   ```kotlin
   fun main() {
       val list = mutableListOf<Any>()
       val dog = Dog("Buddy", "Golden Retriever")

       list.add(dog)  
       val animal: Animal = list[0] as Animal  // Assume it's Animal, but underlying type is Dog can cause confusion
       println((animal as Dog).breed)
   }
   ```

4. **Using Kotlin Coroutines with Shared Mutable State**:
   Sharing mutable state between coroutines might introduce type confusion when using synchronization:

   ```kotlin
   import kotlinx.coroutines.*
   import kotlin.concurrent.thread

   var sharedState: Any = "Initial"

   fun main() {
       runBlocking {
           launch {
               sharedState = 42 
           }
           
           launch {
               val state = sharedState as String  // Assume sharedState is still String leading to type confusion
               println(state.length)
           }
       }
   }
   ```

5. **Custom Marshalers/Unmarshalers in Network Libraries**:
   Incorrect custom serialization/deserialization in libraries like Retrofit can lead to type confusion:

   ```kotlin
   import retrofit2.Retrofit
   import retrofit2.converter.gson.GsonConverterFactory

   // Model class
   open class ApiResponse
   data class UserResponse(val user: String) : ApiResponse()
   data class ErrorResponse(val error: String) : ApiResponse()

   fun main() {
       val retrofit = Retrofit.Builder()
           .baseUrl("https://api.example.com")
           .addConverterFactory(GsonConverterFactory.create())
           .build()

       val service = retrofit.create(ApiService::class.java)
       
       val apiResponse = service.getResponse()  // Assume the response is ApiResponse but it can be UserResponse or ErrorResponse
       when(apiResponse) {
           is UserResponse -> println(apiResponse.user)
           is ErrorResponse -> println(apiResponse.error)
           else -> throw IllegalStateException("Unknown type")
       }
   }
   ```

### Guidelines for Writing SAST Rules

1. **Check Type Casts**: Identify places in the code where type casts are used and ensure proper type validation is enforced.
2. **Monitor Reflection Usage**: Reflection-based dynamic types should be handled with extra caution, and type guards should be in place.
3. **Serialization/Deserialization Validation**: Ensure that serializers/deserializers enforce strict type checks and handle unknown types gracefully.
4. **Generics and Collections**: Ensure collections are used with proper generic type declarations and avoid using raw types.
5. **Interfacing with Native Code**: Inspect JNI/NDK interfaces for type consistency and validate types on boundaries.

By identifying and enforcing rigorous type checks, SAST tools can reduce the incidence of type confusion vulnerabilities with a high false negative and low false positive rate.

Following these examples and guidelines, you can write effective SAST rules to detect potential Type Confusion vulnerabilities in Kotlin applications across different popular frameworks.
