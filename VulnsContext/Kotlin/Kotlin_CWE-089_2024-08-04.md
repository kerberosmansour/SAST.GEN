# Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection') (CWE-089) in Kotlin

###### Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')

#### Introduction
SQL Injection is a type of vulnerability in which an attacker can manipulate a query by injecting malicious SQL code into it. This stems from improper handling of the special elements within SQL commands, such as quotes and other characters used to construct the SQL syntax. The impact of SQL Injection can include unauthorized access to sensitive data, data manipulation, and even complete control over the database server.

### Common Scenarios

1. **Direct SQL Query Concatenation**:
   A simple example where user input is directly concatenated into a SQL query.
   ```kotlin
   fun getUserData(username: String): String {
       val query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '$username'"
       return database.executeQuery(query)
   }
   ```
   If `username` is set to `';DROP TABLE users;--`, it can delete the users table.

2. **Use in Prepared Statements Incorrectly**:
   Even though prepared statements are safer, they can sometimes be used improperly.
   ```kotlin
   fun getUserData(username: String): String {
       val query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ?"
       val statement = connection.prepareStatement(query)
       statement.setString(1, username)
       val resultSet = statement.executeQuery()
       return resultSet.getString(1)
   }
   ```
   Here, even a safe approach might be misconfigured or misused if not systematically checked for parameter types and lengths.

3. **Using ORM Frameworks Vulnerably**:
   ORM frameworks, designed to abstract database interactions, can also be vulnerable.
   ```kotlin
   fun getUserData(username: String): String {
       val query = "FROM User WHERE username = '$username'"
       val user = session.createQuery(query).uniqueResult()
       return user.name
   }
   ```
   In this Hibernate example, direct use of user input in queries can still lead to injection.

### Variations in Kotlin with Different Frameworks

#### 1. **Plain JDBC (Java Database Connectivity)**
   ```kotlin
   fun getUserData(username: String): String {
       val connection: Connection = DriverManager.getConnection(DB_URL, USER, PASSWORD)
       val query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '$username'"
       val statement = connection.createStatement()
       val resultSet = statement.executeQuery(query)
       if (resultSet.next()) {
           return resultSet.getString("data")
       }
       return "No Data"
   }
   ```

#### 2. **JPA (Java Persistence API)**
   ```kotlin
   @PersistenceContext
   lateinit var entityManager: EntityManager

   fun getUserData(username: String): User {
       val query = "SELECT u FROM User u WHERE u.username = '$username'"
       return entityManager.createQuery(query, User::class.java).singleResult
   }
   ```

#### 3. **Spring Data JPA**
   Using repositories can also introduce risks if not handled properly.
   ```kotlin
   interface UserRepository : JpaRepository<User, Long> {
       @Query("SELECT u FROM User u WHERE u.username = ?1")
       fun findByUsername(username: String): User
   }
   ```

#### 4. **Exposed (Kotlin SQL Library)**
   ```kotlin
   object Users : Table() {
       val username = varchar("username", 50)
   }

   fun getUserData(username: String): String {
       Database.connect("jdbc:h2:mem:test", driver = "org.h2.Driver")
       transaction {
           addLogger(StdOutSqlLogger)
           exec("SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '$username'") {
               while (it.next()) {
                   return it.getString("data")
               }
           }
       }
       return "No Data"
   }
   ```

### Best Practices for Prevention

1. **Use Prepared Statements and Parameterized Queries**:
   Ensure that every user input used in SQL commands is properly parameterized, not concatenated directly.

2. **ORM Frameworks Safe Usage**:
   - Use named queries and criteria API provided by the ORM frameworks.
   - Avoid embedding dynamic input directly into JPQL/HQL queries.

3. **Input Validation and Escaping**:
   Perform rigorous input validation and escaping for special characters.

4. **Database Permissions**:
   Restrict database user permissions to only those operations necessary for the application. The principle of least privilege should be maintained.

5. **Regular Code Reviews and Security Testing**:
   Conduct regular code reviews focusing on security. Implement Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tools within the CI/CD pipeline to identify potential SQL Injection vulnerabilities early.

### Conclusion
Writing detection rules for a SAST tool to catch SQL Injection in Kotlin necessitates understanding the various frameworks used and typical code patterns. The SAST rules should identify suspicious use of string concatenation in SQL queries, direct user input in queries, and improper handling of ORM queries. The goal is to ensure low false positive rates while significantly reducing false negatives by covering edge cases and suspicious patterns effectively【4:0†source】    .
