# Uncontrolled Search Path Element (CWE-427) in Kotlin

###### What is Uncontrolled Search Path Element?

An Uncontrolled Search Path Element vulnerability occurs when an application uses a search path that includes directories controlled by an attacker or that are otherwise writeable by unauthorized users. This can lead to malicious versions of files or libraries being loaded instead of the intended ones, enabling potential attacks like arbitrary code execution.

### Variations in Uncontrolled Search Path Element in Kotlin

In Kotlin, Uncontrolled Search Path Element vulnerabilities can manifest in several ways, often depending on the frameworks and libraries being used. Here are some examples:

1. **Kotlin Standard Library: File Operations**
   - Loading external libraries, DLLs, or shared libraries without validating the full path.
   - Example:
     ```kotlin
     val fileName = "malicious.dll"
     System.loadLibrary(fileName)
     ```
   - This code loads a dynamic link library (DLL) using a name given by the user, which can lead to an Uncontrolled Search Path Element vulnerability if an attacker can place a file with the same name in the search path.

2. **Spring Framework**
   - Incorrect usage of resource loading where the path can be influenced by the user.
   - Example:
     ```kotlin
     @GetMapping("/file")
     fun getFile(@RequestParam path: String): ByteArray {
         return File(path).readBytes()
     }
     ```
   - This code snippet reads a file from a path supplied by the user. If the path is not validated, it may lead to the inclusion of unintended files.

3. **Android Development**
   - Handling file URIs obtained from external sources without adequate validation.
   - Example:
     ```kotlin
     val fileUri: Uri = intent.data
     val file = File(fileUri.path)
     ```
   - If the `fileUri` path is not properly sanitized, it could point to any file on the filesystem.

4. **JVM and Class Loaders**
   - Manipulating class paths in a way that allows unauthorized directories to be added to the classpath.
   - Example:
     ```kotlin
     val classPath: String = System.getProperty("java.class.path")
     val mutableClassPath = classPath.split(File.pathSeparator).toMutableList()
     mutableClassPath.add(0, "/untrusted/directory")
     System.setProperty("java.class.path", mutableClassPath.joinToString(File.pathSeparator))
     ```
   - This code modification dynamically changes the class path to include a potentially untrusted directory.

5. **JDBC Drivers and Database Connections**
   - Allowing users to define the path for database connection drivers.
   - Example:
     ```kotlin
     val driverPath: String = getUserInput()
     System.setProperty("jdbc.drivers", driverPath)
     ```
   - This could enable the loading of an untrusted database driver if the path is influenced by user input.

### How to Write SAST Rules

To detect Uncontrolled Search Path Element vulnerabilities in Kotlin with high precision, a SAST tool should focus on the following patterns:

1. **Use of Functions**:
   - Identify functions that load libraries or resources from the filesystem (`System.loadLibrary`, `File` operations, `ClassLoader`, etc.).
   - Check if the paths used in these functions can be influenced by user inputs.

2. **Framework-Specific Patterns**:
   - For Spring, check methods annotated with `@RequestMapping`, `@GetMapping`, and `@PostMapping` that handle file paths.
   - In Android, look for methods or intent handlers that operate on file URIs.

3. **Dynamic Code Loading**:
   - Look for assignments and modifications to `java.class.path` or similar properties that determine where to load classes from.

4. **Database Connections**:
   - Identify where JDBC driver paths and connection properties are being set and ensure these paths are not derived from untrusted sources.

5. **Code Inspections**:
   - Implement checks for concatenation of user inputs with file/directory paths.
   - Ensure input validation exists where path inputs are present.

### Example Rules

Here are some example pseudocode lines for potential SAST rules:
```plaintext
- Detect: System.loadLibrary(libName)
  Condition: libName derived from user input without sanitization

- Detect: new File(path).readBytes()
  Condition: path derived from user input and lacks validation

- Detect: URI.from(intent.data)
  Condition: intent.data unchecked and potentially external

- Detect: System.setProperty("java.class.path", classPath)
  Condition: classPath modified using user input

- Detect: System.setProperty("jdbc.drivers", driverPath)
  Condition: driverPath is influenced by untrusted input
```

By ensuring these patterns are detected, the SAST tool can effectively identify instances of Uncontrolled Search Path Element vulnerabilities in Kotlin applications across different frameworks【4:0†source】【4:1†source】【4:2†source】【4:3†source】【4:4†source】.
