# Uncontrolled Resource Consumption (CWE-400) in Kotlin

#### Understanding Uncontrolled Resource Consumption

**Uncontrolled Resource Consumption** involves exploiting vulnerabilities to exhaust system resources, such as CPU, memory, disk space, network bandwidth, and database connections. The consequences include degraded performance or even complete denial of service (DoS).

### Variations of Uncontrolled Resource Consumption in Kotlin

In the context of Kotlin, especially when using popular frameworks such as Spring Boot, Ktor, or Coroutines, we'll explore various scenarios where uncontrolled resource consumption might occur.

### Examples and Patterns

#### 1. **Uncontrolled Loop or Recursion**

   - **Pattern**: Unbounded loop or recursion based on user input.
   - **Framework**: Any
   - **Example**:
     ```kotlin
     fun processRequest(input: Int) {
         for (i in 1..input) {
             // Process something
         }
     }
     ```
     Without any limits, if `input` is large, this code would consume excessive CPU cycles and memory.

#### 2. **Resource-Intensive File Uploads**

   - **Pattern**: Handling large file uploads without proper restrictions.
   - **Framework**: Spring Boot
   - **Example**:
     ```kotlin
     @PostMapping("/upload")
     fun handleFileUpload(@RequestParam("file") file: MultipartFile) {
         // Directly saving the file without size check
         file.transferTo(File("/some/path/${file.originalFilename}"))
     }
     ```
     This can consume disk space and processing time excessively if large files are uploaded【4:0†source】.

#### 3. **Database Resource Exhaustion**

   - **Pattern**: Insufficient limitation on database queries.
   - **Framework**: Ktor with SQL
   - **Example**:
     ```kotlin
     get("/search") {
         val query = call.request.queryParameters["q"]
         val results = database.executeQuery("SELECT * FROM items WHERE name LIKE '%$query%'")
         call.respond(results)
     }
     ```
     This code may cause the database to process large datasets based on unfiltered user input.

#### 4. **Inadequate Rate Limiting**

   - **Pattern**: No rate limiting on API endpoints.
   - **Framework**: Ktor
   - **Example**:
     ```kotlin
     get("/data") {
         call.respond(dataService.getData())
     }
     ```
     Without rate limiting, this endpoint can be called repeatedly in a short time, consuming server resources.

#### 5. **Thread Creation in Coroutines**

   - **Pattern**: Spawning too many coroutines without control.
   - **Framework**: Kotlin Coroutines
   - **Example**:
     ```kotlin
     suspend fun handleRequest(user: User) {
         for (request in user.requests) {
             launch {
                 processRequest(request)
             }
         }
     }
     ```
     Too many coroutines can exhaust thread pools and CPU resources【4:0†source】.

### Recommendations for SAST Tool Detection Rules

To create effective SAST rules for detecting uncontrolled resource consumption in Kotlin, follow these guidelines:

1. **Identify Unbounded Loops and Recursions**:
   - Look for loops and recursion patterns in the code.
   - Check if they are based on user input without constraining parameters.

2. **File Upload Constraints**:
   - Detect file upload handlers.
   - Ensure they implement size and type restrictions.

3. **Database Query Validations**:
   - Verify that database queries use parameterized inputs.
   - Check for potential full table scans based on user input.

4. **Rate Limiting and Throttling**:
   - Identify endpoints lacking rate-limiting middleware or annotations.
   - Ensure there are mechanisms in place to limit request rates.

5. **Coroutine and Thread Management**:
   - Find coroutine launches in loops or user request handlers.
   - Ensure there is a mechanism to limit the number of concurrently running coroutines.

By detailing these patterns and examples, the SAST tool can be effectively programmed to detect uncontrolled resource consumption vulnerabilities with low false-positive rates while minimizing false negatives. This ensures robust detection and contributes significantly to application security.
