# Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) (CWE-918) in Kotlin

###### Explanation of Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)

**Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)** vulnerabilities occur when a web application processes a remote resource request based on user-provided URL input without properly validating or sanitizing it. This flaw allows an attacker to manipulate the server-side application to send crafted requests to unintended or malicious destinations, potentially bypassing security measures like firewalls, VPNs, or network ACLs. 

Attackers may leverage SSRF vulnerabilities to achieve various objectives, including:
1. **Internal Network Scanning:** Determining open or closed ports on internal servers.
2. **Sensitive Data Access:** Reading local files (e.g., `file:///etc/passwd` on Unix systems) or internal network services.
3. **Cloud Metadata Access:** Fetching sensitive data from cloud provider metadata services (e.g., `http://169.254.169.254/`).
4. **Service Compromise:** Exploiting internal services to execute remote code or initiate denial of service attacks   .

### Implementing SSRF Detection Rules in SAST for Kotlin

When developing Static Application Security Testing (SAST) rules for detecting SSRF vulnerabilities in Kotlin, it is crucial to focus not only on identifying potential misuse of HTTP clients but also on understanding the typical data flow patterns that can lead to such vulnerabilities. The approach includes:

1. **Monitoring HTTP Client Usage:**
   - Identify instances where HTTP clients are instantiated with untrusted user input.

2. **Data Validation and Sanitization Check:**
   - Confirm whether the user-provided URL undergoes proper validation and sanitization.

3. **Configuration and Environment Analysis:**
   - Detect configuration patterns that might expose services to SSRF.

Here are some examples of how SSRF flaws can occur in Kotlin using different frameworks and libraries:

#### Using Ktor Framework
In Ktor applications, SSRF vulnerabilities might arise when developers use the `HttpClient` class to fetch external resources.

```kotlin
val client = HttpClient()
val userProvidedUrl = call.parameters["url"]
val response: HttpResponse = client.get(userProvidedUrl)
```

**Detection Rule:** Look for `HttpClient().get()` involving user-provided input (e.g., parameters, request body). Ensure there are validation steps before making the request.

```kotlin
if (isValidUrl(userProvidedUrl)) {
    val response: HttpResponse = client.get(userProvidedUrl)
}
```

---

#### Java URL Class in Kotlin
SSRF can also occur through the misuse of Java's `URL` class in a Kotlin application.

```kotlin
val urlString = call.parameters["externalUrl"]
val url = URL(urlString)
val inputStream = url.openStream()
```

**Detection Rule:** Identify usage of `java.net.URL.openStream()` with user-provided URLs. Validate URL schemas and enforce a whitelist.

---

#### HttpURLConnection
Misconfiguration or improper usage of `HttpURLConnection` is another pattern prone to SSRF.

```kotlin
val urlString = call.receiveParameters()["targetUrl"]
val url = URL(urlString)
val connection = url.openConnection() as HttpURLConnection
connection.requestMethod = "GET"
val responseCode = connection.responseCode
```

**Detection Rule:** Trace instances of `HttpURLConnection.openConnection()` using user-provided input. Validate and sanitize URL inputs.

---

#### Retrofit Library
Popular for its ease of integration, Retrofit can inadvertently facilitate SSRF if user inputs are not adequately checked.

```kotlin
val retrofit = Retrofit.Builder()
    .baseUrl("https://example.com/")
    .build()

val service = retrofit.create(ApiService::class.java)
val userUrl = userInputs["url"]
service.loadUrl(userUrl).enqueue(object : Callback<ResponseBody> {
    override fun onResponse(call: Call<ResponseBody>, response: Response<ResponseBody>) {
        // handle response
    }
    override fun onFailure(call: Call<ResponseBody>, t: Throwable) {
        // handle failure
    }
})
```

**Detection Rule:** Flag all instances where Retrofit interfaces involve user-supplied URL segments. 

### Summary

For low false positives and high confidence in SSRF detection:
1. **Track Data Flow:** Ensure the SAST tool can trace user input through various transformations to sinks.
2. **Validate Inputs:** Always ensure user-provided input undergoes rigorous validation and whitelisting.
3. **Context Awareness:** The rule should account for various frameworks and popular libraries used in Kotlin development.

By incorporating these patterns and rules into your SAST tool, you can effectively identify potential SSRF vulnerabilities in Kotlin applications, delivering greater security posture while minimizing false positives.
