# Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling (CWE-770) in Kotlin

###### Explanation of Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling

**Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling** refers to situations where resources such as CPU, memory, file handles, network bandwidth, or other system resources are allocated without any restrictions. This can potentially lead to resource exhaustion, denials of service attacks (DoS), and overall system instability. The concept is significant in preventing inefficient resource use that can degrade system performance or cause outages  .

### Examples in Kotlin and Popular Frameworks

To assist in writing SAST detection rules with high accuracy (low false negatives and low false positives), here are several examples in Kotlin across different popular frameworks showing various ways resources may be allocated without limits or throttling.

#### 1. Unbounded File Uploads with Spring Boot
```kotlin
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.*
import org.springframework.web.multipart.MultipartFile
import java.nio.file.Files
import java.nio.file.Paths

@RestController
@RequestMapping("/upload")
class FileUploadController {

    @PostMapping
    fun handleFileUpload(@RequestParam("file") file: MultipartFile) {
        val path = Paths.get("uploads/${file.originalFilename}")
        Files.write(path, file.bytes)
    }
}
```
This example demonstrates unbounded file uploads without restrictions on file size, which can be used to exhaust disk space  .

#### 2. Unthrottled REST API Endpoints with Ktor
```kotlin
import io.ktor.application.*
import io.ktor.response.*
import io.ktor.routing.*
import io.ktor.server.engine.*
import io.ktor.server.netty.*

fun main() {
    embeddedServer(Netty, port = 8080) {
        routing {
            get("/data") {
                // Potentially expensive operation without throttling
                call.respondText("Some data")
            }
        }
    }.start(wait = true)
}
```
In this Ktor-based web server, the `/data` endpoint does not implement any throttle control, potentially allowing a DoS attack via repeated access  .

#### 3. Unrestricted Thread Spawning
```kotlin
import kotlin.concurrent.thread

fun main() {
    while(true) {
        thread {
            val largeArray = IntArray(100000000)
            // Further processing...
        }
    }
}
```
Unrestricted thread spawning without limits or proper management can lead to resource exhaustion, particularly CPU and memory  .

#### 4. Asynchronous Task Execution in Spring Boot without Throttling
```kotlin
import org.springframework.scheduling.annotation.Async
import org.springframework.stereotype.Service

@Service
class TaskService {

    @Async
    fun runHeavyTask() {
        // Resource-intensive task without throttling
        val largeArray = IntArray(100000000)
        // Further processing...
    }
}
```
This Spring Boot service method uses the `@Async` annotation to run tasks asynchronously. Without any throttling, this can lead to resource exhaustion if the method is invoked frequently in a short period  .

#### 5. Allocation of Arbitrary Resources in Micronaut
```kotlin
import io.micronaut.http.annotation.Controller
import io.micronaut.http.annotation.Get

@Controller("/resource")
class ResourceController {

    @Get("/allocate")
    fun allocateResource(): String {
        val largeList = MutableList(10000000) { it }
        return "Resource allocated"
    }
}
```
An endpoint in a Micronaut application that allocates large amounts of memory on each request without any checks or limits can easily lead to memory exhaustion  .

### SAST Detection Guidelines

For writing detection rules in a SAST tool, the following guidelines should be considered:

1. **Pattern Detection**:
    - Identify patterns where resource allocation functions, such as file writes, memory allocation, or thread creation, are used without associated limits or controls.
    
2. **Context Awareness**:
    - Understand the context of the code being scanned. For example, identify loop constructs or URL mappings that could result in repetitive allocation calls.
    
3. **Framework-Specific Checks**:
    - Incorporate framework-specific knowledge, such as checking for asynchronous methods in Spring Boot annotated with `@Async` without associated `@EnableAsyncLimiter` (hypothetical) or custom implementations for async control.

4. **Control Structures**:
    - Look for the absence of control structures around critical resource allocation points, such as missing condition checks, session timeouts, input validation, or rate limiting mechanisms  .

By incorporating these guidelines and examples, SAST detection rules can be created with a focus on detecting the absence of throttling mechanisms accurately across various scenarios, which will help in reducing the rate of false positives and negatives effectively.
