# Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection') (CWE-078) in Kotlin

###### Understanding Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command (OS Command Injection)

#### Definition
Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection') is a security vulnerability that occurs when an application constructs an OS command using user input without properly neutralizing special characters that can alter the intended command. This can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the host operating system.

For example, consider a command input:
```shell
calc
```
which opens the Calculator application. If an attacker modifies it to:
```shell
calc & echo "test"
```
it changes the intended command, causing the Calculator and "test" to be executed  .

#### Argument Injection
Every OS Command Injection can also be considered an argument injection where user input is passed as arguments in a command execution .

### OS Command Injection Variations in Kotlin

Kotlin, being a statically typed language, often shares frameworks and libraries with Java. Below are examples of how OS Command Injection can manifest in Kotlin using popular frameworks.

#### 1. Basic Command Injection
Here's a simple demonstration of an OS Command Injection in Kotlin:
```kotlin
fun executeCommand(cmd: String): String {
    val runtime = Runtime.getRuntime()
    val process = runtime.exec(cmd)
    process.waitFor()
    return process.inputStream.bufferedReader().readText()
}

fun main() {
    val userInput = "calc & echo 'Injected Command'"
    println(executeCommand(userInput))
}
```
In this example, the `userInput` containing special characters can alter the intended command, leading to an OS command injection.

#### 2. Using Spring Boot Framework
Spring Boot applications could be vulnerable when executing system commands based on user input.
```kotlin
@RestController
class CommandController {

    @GetMapping("/execute")
    fun execute(@RequestParam command: String): String {
        val runtime = Runtime.getRuntime()
        val process = runtime.exec(command)
        process.waitFor()
        return process.inputStream.bufferedReader().readText()
    }
}
```
Accessing `http://localhost:8080/execute?command=calc & echo "Injected Command"` could lead to injection exploits.

#### 3. File Read Injection
Command injections can also occur when constructing commands for file operations.
```kotlin
fun unsafeFileRead(filePath: String) {
    val command = "cat $filePath"
    val runtime = Runtime.getRuntime()
    val process = runtime.exec(command)
    println(process.inputStream.bufferedReader().readText())
}

fun main() {
    // Potentially unsafe file path input
    unsafeFileRead("/etc/passwd; echo 'Injected'")
}
```

#### 4. Apache Commons Exec Library
Using `Apache Commons Exec` in Kotlin can be an entry point for OS command injection.
```kotlin
import org.apache.commons.exec.DefaultExecutor
import org.apache.commons.exec.CommandLine

fun apacheExec(command: String) {
    val cmdLine = CommandLine.parse(command)
    val executor = DefaultExecutor()
    executor.execute(cmdLine)
}

fun main() {
    val dangerousInput = "calc & echo 'Injected Command'"
    apacheExec(dangerousInput)
}
```

### Writing SAST Rules for Detection

To write effective Static Application Security Testing (SAST) rules that yield high true positive and low false negative rates, consider the following approach:

1. **Identify Key API Calls**:
   - Focus on methods like `Runtime.getRuntime().exec()` and similar APIs from libraries (`Apache Commons Exec`, Spring Boot).

2. **Pattern Matching for User Input Usage**:
   - Detect patterns where user input is directly passed to these commands.

3. **Keyword and Character Checks**:
   - Check for the presence of special characters (`&`, `|`, `;`, etc.) in user input that are concatenated or interpolated into command strings.

4. **Code Context Analysis**:
   - Ensure that input validation and sanitization functions are not altering potentially dangerous inputs improperly.

Below is a pseudo-SAST rule for detecting potential OS command injections in Kotlin code:
```plaintext
RULE: DetectPotentialOSCommandInjection
DESCRIPTION: Detects OS Command Injection vulnerabilities in Kotlin
PATTERNS:
  - Regex: "Runtime.getRuntime().exec(\"[^\"]+\$[A-Za-z_]+[^\"]*\")"
    Explanation: Detects usage of user-controlled variables in exec() without sanitization
  - Regex: "CommandLine.parse\(.+\)"
    Explanation: Detects potential unsafe usage in Apache Commons Exec
  - Framework Specific: Spring Controller methods using exec()
    Explanation: Pattern match for Spring @RequestParam directly used in exec method
ADDITIONAL CHECKS:
  - Check for Input Variables: Ensure user input is not concatenated or interpolated into command strings
  - Detect Special Characters: Identify unsafe characters in input handling
  - Validate Input Sanitization: Ensure proper input validation and escaping if using user input
```

By covering common patterns and integrating context-aware analysis, the SAST rules will provide a robust detection mechanism for OS command injection vulnerabilities  .
