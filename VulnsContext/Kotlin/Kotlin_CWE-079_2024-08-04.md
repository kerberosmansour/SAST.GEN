# Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') (CWE-079) in Kotlin

#### Explanation of Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') (XSS)

### General Overview
Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation, commonly known as Cross-site Scripting (XSS), is a software vulnerability where user-supplied input is improperly handled and injected into web pages in a manner that can be executed by a web browser. XSS attacks typically involve malicious scripts executed in a user’s browser, which can lead to unauthorized actions, data theft, session hijacking, and other serious security impacts.

### Types of XSS

1. **Stored XSS:** Malicious script is stored on the target server (e.g., in a database), and every time a user visits the web page, the script is served along with the legitimate content.

2. **Reflected XSS:** Malicious script is reflected off a web application onto the user’s browser. The script is typically embedded in a URL parameter or form submission and executed when the URL is accessed.

3. **DOM-based XSS:** Malicious script is executed as a result of altering the Document Object Model (DOM) in the victim's browser. Unlike other forms of XSS, it does not require server-side involvement.

## XSS in Kotlin: Examples and Detection

For an author of SAST (Static Application Security Testing) tool detection rules, understanding the variations of XSS vulnerabilities in Kotlin, especially when using popular web frameworks, is crucial. Below are several scenarios that showcase different XSS vulnerabilities with Kotlin examples:

### In Pure Kotlin
#### Example 1: Simple Reflection in Kotlin
```kotlin
val userInput = request.getParameter("input")
val writer = response.writer
writer.println("<html><body>Hello, ${userInput}!</body></html>")
```
*Potential Issue:* If `userInput` includes JavaScript code, it will be executed in the user’s browser.

### In Ktor Framework
#### Example 2: Ktor with Embedded HTML
```kotlin
get("/welcome") {
    call.respondText("""
        <html>
            <body>Welcome, ${call.request.queryParameters["name"]}!</body>
        </html>
    """.trimIndent())
}
```
*Potential Issue:* The `name` parameter is directly injected without validation or encoding.

### In Spring Boot with Kotlin
#### Example 3: Using Thymeleaf in Spring Boot
```kotlin
@Controller
class HelloWorldController {
    @GetMapping("/greeting")
    fun greeting(@RequestParam name: String, model: Model): String {
        model.addAttribute("name", name)
        return "greeting"
    }
}
```
*Potential Issue:* If the `greeting.html` template contains `${name}`, untrusted data will be directly rendered without encoding.

#### Example 4: Using Kotlin and JSP
```kotlin
val name = request.getParameter("name")
val out: PrintWriter = response.writer
out.println("<html><body>Welcome, $name!</body></html>")
out.close()
```
*Potential Issue:* If `name` parameter contains malicious script, it will be executed in the browser.

### Using Templating Engines
#### Example 5: Freemarker in Ktor with Unsanitized Input
```kotlin
post("/users") {
    val userInput = call.receiveParameters()["name"] ?: ""
    val model = mapOf("name" to userInput)
    call.respond(FreeMarkerContent("welcome.ftl", model))
}
```
`welcome.ftl` can have the following:
```html
<p>Welcome, ${name}</p>
```
*Potential Issue:* If `name` contains malicious code, it will be rendered unsanitized.

## Universal Mitigation Strategies
1. **Output Encoding:** Always encode user input before rendering it on the web page.
    - **HTML Encoding:** Encode special characters such as `<`, `>`, `&`, and `'`.
    - **JavaScript Encoding:** Encode user input when it needs to be used in JavaScript to prevent XSS.
    
2. **Input Validation:** Validate inputs against known patterns or use whitelisting techniques.

3. **Sanitization Libraries:** Utilize libraries like OWASP Java Encoder for safe encoding of user data.

4. **Template Engine Best Practices:** Ensure that the template engines auto-escape user-supplied values.

5. **Use a Content Security Policy (CSP):** A well-defined CSP helps in mitigating the risks posed by XSS.

## Conclusion
The detection of XSS in Kotlin across different frameworks requires understanding the specific code constructs and contexts where user input is handled. By implementing SAST rules that track data flow from user inputs to output constructs, especially those involving HTML/JavaScript templating, effective detection can be achieved with high precision and low false positives.
