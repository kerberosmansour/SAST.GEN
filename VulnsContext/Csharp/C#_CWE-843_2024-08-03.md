# Access of Resource Using Incompatible Type ('Type Confusion') (CWE-843) in C#

###### Understanding Access of Resource Using Incompatible Type ('Type Confusion')

Type confusion vulnerabilities occur when a program accesses a resource (such as an object or memory location) using an incompatible type. This can result in unpredictable behavior, such as reading or writing beyond the intended boundaries of the resource, leading to security vulnerabilities like data corruption, denial of service, or even remote code execution.

### Type Confusion Vulnerabilities in C#

#### Explanation
In C#, type confusion can occur when the type safety guarantees of the language are circumvented. This can happen in a variety of ways, such as improper casting, deserialization issues, or misuse of dynamic types. Attackers exploit these vulnerabilities to manipulate the programâ€™s behavior in unintended ways.

#### Common Scenarios
1. **Improper Casting**: This occurs when a program casts an object to a type that it is not actually an instance of.
2. **Deserialization Issues**: When deserializing an object from untrusted data, the type information can be tampered with to induce type confusion.
3. **Dynamic Types Misuse**: Using `dynamic` types or reflection in an unsafe manner can lead to type confusion.

### Examples in C#

#### Example 1: Improper Casting
```csharp
object obj = "Hello, World!";
int number = (int)obj;  // Invalid cast leading to type confusion
```
In this example, casting a string to an integer is invalid. If unchecked, it can cause a runtime exception and potentially reveal sensitive information.

#### Example 2: Insecure Deserialization
Using JSON.Net:
```csharp
string jsonString = "{ '$type': 'System.IO.FileInfo, mscorlib', 'Path': 'C:\\windows\\system32\\cmd.exe' }";
JsonConvert.DeserializeObject(jsonString, new JsonSerializerSettings
{
    TypeNameHandling = TypeNameHandling.All
});
// RCE vulnerability due to insecure type deserialization
```
To mitigate this, ensure that `TypeNameHandling` is set to `None`:
```csharp
JsonConvert.DeserializeObject(jsonString, new JsonSerializerSettings
{
    TypeNameHandling = TypeNameHandling.None
});
```
This will prevent the deserialization mechanism from creating arbitrary types specified in the input JSON.

#### Example 3: Dynamic Types Misuse
```csharp
dynamic dyn = "This is a string";
int length = dyn.Length;  // Works as expected
dyn = new { Length = 42 };
length = dyn.Length;  // Still works due to dynamic typing
dyn = 12345;
length = dyn.Length;  // RuntimeBinderException
```
Dynamic variables may change types across assignments, leading to type confusion if not handled properly.

### Type Confusion in Popular Frameworks

#### ASP.NET
In ASP.NET MVC, type confusion can occur through model binding:

```csharp
public ActionResult UpdateUser(UserModel user)
{
    dynamic untrustedInput = GetUserInput();  // Assuming dynamic input
    user = (UserModel)untrustedInput;  // Type confusion if input is not of UserModel
    // Process user
}
```
To prevent this, always validate and sanitize incoming data before processing it.

### Writing SAST Rules for Detection

To write effective Static Application Security Testing (SAST) rules to detect type confusion with high accuracy (high false negative and low false positive rates), consider the following:

1. **Pattern Matching for Unsafe Casts**: Identify patterns where explicit casting is used. Check for scenarios where the casted type and actual type might differ.
2. **Deserialization Checks**: Scan for deserialization settings, especially in JSON libraries. Flag instances where `TypeNameHandling` is not set to `None`.
3. **Dynamic Type Usage**: Detect the usage of `dynamic` keyword and flag scenarios where assignments from dynamic types might lead to type confusion.
4. **Reflection Usage**: Identify instances of reflection where types are being dynamically invoked and ensure the target types are validated.

#### Example Rule 1: Detecting Unsafe Casts
Look for explicit casts that can potentially fail:
```regex
\( \w+ \) \s* \w+
```
Flag any cast operations and require manual verification if the cast's validity depends on external or unchecked data.

#### Example Rule 2: Unsafe Deserialization Settings
Look for JSON.Net deserialization settings with dangerous configurations:
```regex
TypeNameHandling \s* = \s* TypeNameHandling\.All
```
Suggest configuring `TypeNameHandling` to `None` as a safe practice.

By implementing these rules, SAST tools can more effectively identify type confusion vulnerabilities and help developers secure their applications against potential exploits.

### Conclusion
Type Confusion is a critical issue in software security, especially for languages like C# where improper type handling can lead to severe vulnerabilities. Understanding the scenarios where these vulnerabilities occur and establishing robust detection mechanisms are essential for maintaining secure codebases.
