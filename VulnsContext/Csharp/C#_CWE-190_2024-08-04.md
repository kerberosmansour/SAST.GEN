# Integer Overflow or Wraparound (CWE-190) in C#

###### Integer Overflow or Wraparound

#### Concept Explanation
**Integer Overflow** occurs when an arithmetic operation attempts to create a numeric value that is outside the range that can be represented within the allocated storage space for that data type. When this happens, the number wraps around to the lowest value in the range or one point above the highest value, depending on the overflow direction (positive or negative).

**Wraparound**, technically a type of integer overflow, refers specifically to the phenomenon where the value "wraps" to the beginning of the range upon exceeding the upper or lower bounds. This is typically observed in unsigned integers but can also happen with signed integers, depending on the implemented representation (e.g., two's complement for signed integers).

#### Relevance in Security
Integer overflows can lead to unpredictable behavior in software, including security vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows, incorrect logic, and unauthorized access to resources. These issues can be used by attackers to manipulate software behavior or cause software to crash, leading to denial of service.

### Variations in C# and Popular Frameworks
In C#, integer overflow behavior can vary based on the context, such as application settings (checked/unchecked contexts), data type (e.g., `int`, `uint`, `long`, `ulong`), and framework specifics (e.g., .NET Framework, .NET Core).

#### Basic Overflow Example in C#
```csharp
int maxValue = int.MaxValue;
int result = maxValue + 1;  // This will result in an overflow.
```

This code snippet will cause an overflow, wrapping the value around to a negative number, specifically `int.MinValue`.

#### Checked Context in C#
Using a checked context in C# ensures that overflow operations throw exceptions, preventing wraparound:
```csharp
try
{
    int maxValue = int.MaxValue;
    int result = checked(maxValue + 1);  // This will throw an OverflowException.
}
catch (OverflowException ex)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Overflow occurred.");
}
```

#### Unchecked Context in C#
Conversely, using an unchecked context, no exceptions are thrown, and the integer can wrap:
```csharp
int maxValue = int.MaxValue;
int result = unchecked(maxValue + 1);  // No exception; result is int.MinValue.
```

#### Unsigned Integer Overflow
Unsigned integers wrap around from their maximum value to zero:
```csharp
uint maxValue = uint.MaxValue;
uint result = maxValue + 1;  // This will wrap around to 0.
```

#### .NET Framework & .NET Core
Both frameworks exhibit similar behavior regarding integer overflows with minor differences in error handling and performance across different versions.

##### Example Using Long Data Type
```csharp
long maxValue = long.MaxValue;
long result = maxValue + 1;  // Results in overflow, wrapping around to long.MinValue.
```

### SAST Rule Example for Detection
To detect integer overflow or wraparound efficiently in a SAST tool with high precision and low false positives, some focus points include:

1. **Checked and Unchecked Contexts**: Detect arithmetic operations within unchecked contexts or without a context in codebases expecting safe arithmetic.
2. **Max/Min Value Operations**: Look for operations involving data type boundaries like `int.MaxValue`, `int.MinValue`, `uint.MaxValue`, etc.
3. **Type Specifications**: Identify operations on types prone to overflow (`int`, `uint`, `long`, `ulong`, etc.).

### Example SAST Rules in Pseudocode
1. **Unchecked Arithmetic Operations Rule**:
   - **Description**: Detect arithmetic operations in unchecked contexts or without any checked/unchecked context in configuration.
   - **Pseudocode**: 
     ```pseudocode
     if operation in (addition, subtraction, multiplication):
       if not within checked block or unchecked block:
         report "Potential integer overflow without checks"
     ```

2. **Boundary Condition Rule**:
   - **Description**: Identify operations that surpass the boundary values of integer data types.
   - **Pseudocode**:
     ```pseudocode
     if value in (int.MaxValue, int.MinValue, uint.MaxValue) and operation in (addition, subtraction):
       report "Potential integer overflow at data type boundary"
     ```

### Conclusion
To create effective SAST rules for integer overflow or wraparound detection in C#, the focus should be on understanding arithmetic operation contexts and their relation to type boundaries. Incorporating analyzed configurations and commonly affected types within popular frameworks ensures reduced false negatives and low false positives, enhancing security posture against such vulnerabilities.
