# Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) (CWE-352) in C#

#### Explaining Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

### What is CSRF?
Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) is a type of attack that occurs when a malicious actor tricks an authenticated user into inadvertently executing unwanted actions on a trusted web application. Essentially, CSRF exploits the trust that a site has in a user's browser. When a user is authenticated, browsers automatically include credentials and cookies, including session tokens with requests. An attacker leverages this by sending a crafted request to the user, which, when executed, performs actions on behalf of the user without their consent.

### Example Scenario
For instance, if a user is logged into a banking application, an attacker could trick the user into visiting a malicious site that sends a money transfer request to the bank application. Since the user is authenticated, the bank would execute this request, transferring money from the authenticated user's account to an attacker-controlled account.

### Mitigation Techniques
Several methods exist to protect against CSRF attacks:
1. **CSRF Tokens**: Including a unique token in each request that changes each session.
2. **Double Submit Cookies**: Requiring a custom cookie that matches a token submitted with forms.
3. **SameSite Cookie Attribute**: Setting cookies that are not sent with cross-site requests.
4. **Custom Headers**: Using custom headers in AJAX requests to confirm the origin of the request.

### CSRF Vulnerabilities in C# and Popular Frameworks
In the context of C#, CSRF vulnerabilities can occur across various frameworks like ASP.NET and ASP.NET Core. Here are examples of different CSRF vulnerabilities and mitigations.

#### ASP.NET MVC
ASP.NET MVC has built-in CSRF protection via `AntiForgeryToken`. However, improper implementation can lead to vulnerabilities.
  
**Example 1: Improper CSRF Protection**
```csharp
// Action without CSRF protection
[HttpPost]
public ActionResult TransferFunds(int amount)
{
    // Logic to transfer funds
    return View();
}
```

**Mitigation:**
Using `ValidateAntiForgeryToken`:
```csharp
// Apply CSRF protection
[HttpPost]
[ValidateAntiForgeryToken]
public ActionResult TransferFunds(int amount)
{
    // Logic to transfer funds
    return View();
}
```

#### ASP.NET Core
ASP.NET Core also supports anti-forgery tokens, but it's crucial developers use them correctly.

**Example 2: Missing CSRF Tokens in ASP.NET Core**
```csharp
// No anti-forgery token validation
[HttpPost]
public IActionResult CreatePost(BlogPost post)
{
    // Logic to create a blog post
    return View();
}
```

**Mitigation:**
Using `ValidateAntiForgeryToken` and form tokens:
```csharp
// Apply CSRF protection
[HttpPost]
[ValidateAntiForgeryToken]
public IActionResult CreatePost(BlogPost post)
{
    // Logic to create a blog post
    return View();
}
```

Form and Razor Page:
```html
<form asp-action="CreatePost" method="post">
    <input asp-for="Title" />
    <input asp-for="Content" />
    <button type="submit">Create</button>
    @Html.AntiForgeryToken()
</form>
```

#### Web API with Custom Headers
When dealing with APIs, using anti-forgery tokens might not be straightforward. Custom headers can help mitigate CSRF.

**Example 3: API Without CSRF Protection**
```csharp
[HttpPost]
public IActionResult UpdateUserProfile(UserProfile profile)
{
    // Logic to update user profile
    return Ok();
}
```

**Mitigation:**
Adding and validating custom headers (e.g., using `X-CSRF-Token`):
```csharp
[HttpPost]
public IActionResult UpdateUserProfile(UserProfile profile)
{
    if (Request.Headers["X-CSRF-Token"] != expectedToken)
    {
        return Unauthorized();
    }
    // Logic to update user profile
    return Ok();
}
```

Header added in the AJAX request:
```javascript
$.ajax({
    type: "POST",
    url: "/api/updateUserProfile",
    data: JSON.stringify(profile),
    contentType: "application/json",
    headers: {
        "X-CSRF-Token": csrfToken
    },
    success: function(response) {
        // handle response
    }
});
```

### Recommendations for SAST Rule Authoring
To detect CSRF vulnerabilities effectively, focus on:
1. **Presence of CSRF Tokens**: Ensure that any form submission includes anti-forgery tokens and that server-side validation is present.
2. **Custom Headers**: For APIs, verify that custom headers are utilized and validated.
3. **Correct Placement**: Ensure that CSRF protection attributes are applied to actions that modify state.
4. **Framework Defaults**: Where frameworks offer built-in CSRF protection, ensure it's utilized correctly.

Incorporating these checks will ensure that the rules generated will have high false negative and low false positive rates, thus accurately pinpointing genuine security issues.

By understanding how CSRF vulnerabilities manifest and utilizing best practices for detection and mitigation, we can significantly enhance the security posture of web applications built in C#.
