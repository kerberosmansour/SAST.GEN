# Deserialization of Untrusted Data (CWE-502) in C#

###### Understanding Deserialization of Untrusted Data

**Deserialization** is the process of reconstructing an object from a data format that was previously serialized. However, when dealing with data from untrusted sources, this process poses significant security risks. **Deserialization of untrusted data** can allow attackers to inject malicious objects or data structures into the application, which could potentially be executed or trigger unexpected behavior.

### Common Risks Associated with Deserialization of Untrusted Data

1. **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Attackers can exploit deserialization vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code on the server.
2. **Denial of Service (DoS):** Malformed or excessive data can lead to application crashes or resource exhaustion.
3. **Injection Attacks:** The deserialization process can be manipulated to inject malicious data into the application.

### General Preventive Measures

- Use data formats that do not support complex types (e.g., JSON and XML configurations without type information).
- Implement strict input validation and data integrity checks before deserialization.
- Use allowlists to restrict deserialization to specific, known-safe types.
- Update and patch libraries and frameworks to mitigate known vulnerabilities.

### Example in C#

Below are several C# code examples and scenarios demonstrating insecure deserialization across commonly used frameworks. These cases illustrate the potential pitfalls and guide how to identify them.

#### 1. .NET BinaryFormatter

The `BinaryFormatter` is commonly used for serializing and deserializing object graphs in .NET. However, Microsoft has marked it as insecure.

```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Binary;

public class InsecureDeserialization
{
    public static void Deserialize(byte[] data)
    {
        var formatter = new BinaryFormatter();
        using (var stream = new MemoryStream(data))
        {
            // Dangerous deserialization
            var obj = formatter.Deserialize(stream);
        }
    }
}
```

**Detection Rule for SAST:**
1. Flag usage of `BinaryFormatter.Deserialize`.
2. Check for usage in conjunction with untrusted data sources.

#### 2. DataContractSerializer

Similar issues can occur with `DataContractSerializer`, especially if the type information is dynamically determined.

```csharp
using System;
using System.Runtime.Serialization;
using System.Runtime.Serialization.Json;
using System.IO;

public class InsecureDataContract
{
    public static void Deserialize(string jsonData, string typeName)
    {
        var serializer = new DataContractJsonSerializer(Type.GetType(typeName));
        using (var stream = new MemoryStream(System.Text.Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(jsonData)))
        {
            // Dangerous deserialization
            var obj = serializer.ReadObject(stream);
        }
    }
}
```

**Detection Rule for SAST:**
1. Look for `DataContractJsonSerializer` or `DataContractSerializer` instantiations.
2. Check if type information is derived from potentially untrusted sources.

#### 3. Newtonsoft.Json (JSON.NET)

Configuration allowing type information to be pulled from JSON data can be hazardous (`TypeNameHandling`).

```csharp
using Newtonsoft.Json;

public class InsecureJsonNet
{
    public static void Deserialize(string jsonData)
    {
        var settings = new JsonSerializerSettings
        {
            // Insecure setting
            TypeNameHandling = TypeNameHandling.All
        };
        var obj = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject(jsonData, settings);
    }
}
```

**Detection Rule for SAST:**
1. Identify `JsonSerializerSettings` with `TypeNameHandling` set to any value other than `None`.

#### 4. JavaScriptSerializer

Using JavaScriptSerializer with a resolver can enable similar security risks.

```csharp
using System.Web.Script.Serialization;

public class InsecureJavaScriptSerializer
{
    public static void Deserialize(string jsonData)
    {
        var serializer = new JavaScriptSerializer(new SimpleTypeResolver());
        var obj = serializer.Deserialize<object>(jsonData);
    }
}
```

**Detection Rule for SAST:**
1. Highlight uses of `JavaScriptSerializer` when constructed with `JavaScriptTypeResolver`.

### Structures of SAST Rules

Given the outlined examples, you can construct SAST detection rules focusing on:
- Patterns matching the initialization and method calls of insecure deserialization objects.
- Identifying clauses where dynamic type information or settings are used.
- Contextual analysis to check sources of data being deserialized, ensuring it's marked as untrusted.

### Conclusion

By understanding and identifying the different ways deserialization of untrusted data can occur in C#, you can effectively write SAST rules to detect insecure patterns. Focus on reducing false negatives while minimizing false positives to ensure high reliability in detecting genuine security vulnerabilities.
