# Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) (CWE-918) in C#

###### Understanding Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)

**Definition:**
Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) flaws occur when a web application fetches a remote resource without properly validating the user-supplied URL. This vulnerability allows an attacker to coerce the application into sending crafted requests to unexpected destinations, potentially bypassing firewall, VPN, or other network access control measures.

**Prevention Techniques:**

**From Network Layer:**
- Segment remote resource access functionality in separate networks.
- Enforce "deny by default" firewall policies to block non-essential intranet traffic.
- Ensure ownership and lifecycle for firewall rules based on applications.
- Log all accepted and blocked network flows on firewalls.

**From Application Layer:**
- Sanitize and validate all client-supplied input data.
- Enforce the URL schema, port, and destination with a positive allow list.
- Disable HTTP redirections.
- Be aware of DNS rebinding and time-of-check, time-of-use (TOCTOU) race conditions to avoid URL consistency issues.
- Do not mitigate SSRF using deny lists or regular expressions as they can be bypassed by attackers.

**Additional Measures:**
- Avoid deploying security-relevant services (e.g., OpenID) on front systems and control local traffic.
- For frontends with dedicated user groups, use network encryption (e.g., VPNs) on independent systems to ensure high protection【4:16†source】.

### SSRF Examples in C#

To aid in writing SAST rules that have high accuracy with low false positives, it's essential to understand the potential variations of SSRF in C#. Here are some examples across popular frameworks:

#### 1. Basic HttpClient SSRF
##### Vulnerable Code:
```csharp
using System;
using System.Net.Http;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

public class SSRF
{
    public async Task<string> GetContent(string url)
    {
        HttpClient client = new HttpClient();
        HttpResponseMessage response = await client.GetAsync(url);
        return await response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();
    }
}
```
**Detection Rule:**
- Detect usage of HttpClient with URLs derived from user input.

#### 2. RestClient SSRF (RestSharp)
##### Vulnerable Code:
```csharp
using RestSharp;

public class SSRF
{
    public string GetContent(string url)
    {
        var client = new RestClient(url);
        var request = new RestRequest(Method.GET);
        IRestResponse response = client.Execute(request);
        return response.Content;
    }
}
```
**Detection Rule:**
- Rule to detect instantiating RestClient with user-provided URLs.

#### 3. WebRequest SSRF (System.Net)
##### Vulnerable Code:
```csharp
using System.Net;

public class SSRF
{
    public string GetResponse(string url)
    {
        WebRequest request = WebRequest.Create(url);
        using (WebResponse response = request.GetResponse())
        {
            using (var stream = response.GetResponseStream())
            {
                var reader = new StreamReader(stream);
                return reader.ReadToEnd();
            }
        }
    }
}
```
**Detection Rule:**
- Detect usage of WebRequest.Create with dynamic/user-supplied URLs.

#### 4. HttpWebRequest SSRF
##### Vulnerable Code:
```csharp
using System.Net;

public class SSRF
{
    public string GetResponse(string url)
    {
        HttpWebRequest request = (HttpWebRequest)WebRequest.Create(url);
        using (HttpWebResponse response = (HttpWebResponse)request.GetResponse())
        {
            using (var stream = response.GetResponseStream())
            {
                var reader = new StreamReader(stream);
                return reader.ReadToEnd();
            }
        }
    }
}
```
**Detection Rule:**
- Detect HttpWebRequest object creation with user-input URLs.

### Key Points for SAST Rule Development:
1. **URL Validation:** Ensure user input used in network requests undergo proper validation against a positive allow list.
2. **Library/Framework Identification:** Identify which HTTP libraries/frameworks are utilized (e.g., `HttpClient`, `RestClient`, `WebRequest`, `HttpWebRequest`).
3. **Pattern Matching:** Develop pattern-matching rules for URLs being derived from insecure sources (e.g., query parameters, form inputs).
4. **Contextual Analysis:** Consider the context in which the URL is used. Rules should discern between URLs fetched from known safe sources versus user inputs.

Implementing these rules assists in identifying potential SSRF vulnerabilities and helps you devise effective methods of mitigation【4:15†source】【4:16†source】.
