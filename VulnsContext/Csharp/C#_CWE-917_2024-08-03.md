# Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an Expression Language Statement ('Expression Language Injection') (CWE-917) in C#

#### Understanding Expression Language Injection (EL Injection)

### Definition
Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an Expression Language Statement, commonly known as Expression Language (EL) Injection, is a type of injection vulnerability where an attacker can manipulate a pre-defined expression language syntax used in various software frameworks. EL Injection occurs when user input is improperly sanitized and directly embedded into dynamically evaluated expression language statements, potentially allowing attackers to execute arbitrary code, access sensitive data, or manipulate the application behavior.

### Occurrence in C#
EL Injection can manifest in various forms in C#, especially within popular frameworks or custom templating solutions, where expressions are evaluated dynamically based on user input.

### Common Scenarios and Examples in C#
Below are several variations of how EL Injection can manifest in C# across different frameworks and technologies.

#### 1. Razor Pages (ASP.NET Core MVC)
Razor syntax in ASP.NET Core MVC is commonly used to embed server-side code within HTML markup. If user input is improperly sanitized, it can result in EL Injection.

**Vulnerable Code:**
```csharp
@{
    var userInput = Request.Query["name"];
    var template = $"<div> Hello, {userInput} </div>";
    @Html.Raw(template)
}
```

**Explanation:**
The `Html.Raw` method is used to render raw HTML, and the `userInput` is directly concatenated into the template without sanitization, allowing potential script injection.

**Remediation:**
Ensure that user inputs are properly encoded:
```csharp
@{
    var userInput = Request.Query["name"];
    var template = $"<div> Hello, @Html.Encode(userInput) </div>";
    @Html.Raw(template)
}
```

#### 2. .NET Core Expressions 
The `System.Linq.Dynamic` library or dynamic LINQ queries can also lead to EL Injection if user input is directly used in expression parsing.

**Vulnerable Code:**
```csharp
var input = "Age > 30"; // User input
var users = dbContext.Users.Where(input).ToList();
```

**Explanation:**
The user input is directly inserted into the dynamic expression, allowing arbitrary code execution if malicious input is provided.

**Remediation:**
Use parameterized queries instead of dynamic expressions:
```csharp
var input = "30"; // User input
var users = dbContext.Users.Where(u => u.Age > int.Parse(input)).ToList();
```

#### 3. Templating Engines (e.g., Handlebars.Net)
Templating engines in C# that process user input to render dynamic content can also be vulnerable.

**Vulnerable Code:**
```csharp
var userInput = "{{dangerous_expression}}";
var template = Handlebars.Compile(userInput);
var result = template(new { Name = "World" });
```

**Explanation:**
The user input is directly compiled into the template, and dangerous expressions can be executed.

**Remediation:**
Validate and escape user input before compiling the template:
```csharp
var userInput = "{{dangerous_expression}}";
var safeUserInput = WebUtility.HtmlEncode(userInput);
var template = Handlebars.Compile(safeUserInput);
var result = template(new { Name = "World" });
```

### Writing SAST Rules for EL Injection
To write precise SAST (Static Application Security Testing) rules with high false negative and low false positive rates, consider the following guidelines:

1. **Pattern Matching for Dynamic Evaluation:** Identify patterns where dynamic evaluation methods like `Html.Raw`, `System.Linq.Dynamic` methods, and custom template compilation methods are used. Flag instances where user input is directly concatenated or embedded into these methods without proper sanitization or encoding.

2. **Context-aware Encoding Checks:** Ensure that the SAST rules check if user inputs being used in dynamic expressions are encoded according to the context (HTML encoding for Razor views, SQL parameterization for queries, etc.).

3. **Whitelist-based Approach for Templates:** Detect if any templating engine is used and validate that user inputs are only allowed through a strict whitelist to prevent unintended execution of expressions.

4. **Data Flow Analysis:** Perform a comprehensive data flow analysis to trace user input from the source (e.g., HTTP request) to the sink (e.g., dynamic evaluation statement) and flag unsafe data flows.

5. **Custom Rules for Popular Frameworks:** Create specific rules for popular frameworks like ASP.NET Core (Razor Pages, MVC), .NET Core LINQ, and templating engines to check for potential injection points and validate safe coding practices are enforced.

### Conclusion
Expression Language Injection is a critical security vulnerability that can lead to severe consequences if user inputs are not properly sanitized. By understanding how EL Injection can occur in C# and implementing comprehensive SAST rules, it is possible to detect and remediate such vulnerabilities effectively, ensuring the security of applications.
