# Uncontrolled Resource Consumption (CWE-400) in C#

###### Uncontrolled Resource Consumption: Explanation and C# Examples

#### What is Uncontrolled Resource Consumption?
Uncontrolled Resource Consumption is a software vulnerability that occurs when an application inadequately manages the usage of resources such as memory, CPU, threads, or file handles. This can lead to resource exhaustion, causing the system to degrade in performance or even crash. Attackers exploit this vulnerability to perform Denial of Service (DoS) attacks by overwhelming the system with requests or resource-intensive operations.

#### Variations in C#
In C#, Uncontrolled Resource Consumption can occur in various forms and can be particularly troublesome in different frameworks. Below, I will illustrate multiple scenarios and variations:

1. **Memory Leaks**: Ineffective memory management leading to excessive memory usage.
   ```csharp
   // Example of unmanaged resource allocation without proper disposal
   public void LoadLargeDataSet()
   {
       var largeData = new byte[100000000]; // 100MB
       // Process data...
   }
   ```
   
   **Framework: .NET Core / .NET Framework**
   
   **Detection**: Look for large allocations without corresponding disposal.
   
2. **Thread Leaks**: Poor management of threads leading to excessive consumption of thread pool resources.
   ```csharp
   // Example of creating threads in a loop without proper control
   public void StartThreads()
   {
       for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++)
       {
           new Thread(() =>
           {
               while (true)
               {
                   // Intensive work
               }
           }).Start();
       }
   }
   ```
   
   **Framework: ASP.NET / ASP.NET Core**
   
   **Detection**: Detect the creation of numerous threads within a loop.
   
3. **File Handle Leaks**: Opening files without properly closing them.
   ```csharp
   // Example of not closing file streams
   public void ProcessFiles(List<string> filenames)
   {
       foreach (string filename in filenames)
       {
           var fileStream = new FileStream(filename, FileMode.Open);
           // Process file...
       }
   }
   ```
   
   **Framework: All C# applications**
   
   **Detection**: Look for `FileStream` or similar objects without proper disposal.
   
4. **Unoptimized LINQ Queries**: Queries that consume excessive CPU and memory resources.
   ```csharp
   // Inefficient LINQ query leading to high resource consumption
   var largeDataSet = GetLargeDataSet();
   var result = largeDataSet.Where(x => ComplexCondition(x)).ToList();
   
   private bool ComplexCondition(DataItem x)
   {
       // Complex condition involving multiple checks
   }
   ```
   
   **Framework: Entity Framework / LINQ to SQL**
   
   **Detection**: Identify LINQ queries with complex conditions and large data sets.

5. **Excessive Session Information Storage**: Storing too much data in session state can cause significant performance issues.
   ```csharp
   // Example of storing a large object in session
   public void StoreInSession(HttpContext context, LargeObject obj)
   {
       context.Session.SetObject("LargeData", obj);
   }
   ```
   
   **Framework: ASP.NET Core**
   
   **Detection**: Check for excessively large objects being stored in session.

6. **Infinite Loop**: Code constructs that inadvertently create infinite loops, leading to resource exhaustion.
   ```csharp
   // Example of an infinite loop
   public void RunInfiniteLoop()
   {
       while (true)
       {
           // Do some work
       }
   }
   ```
   
   **Framework: All C# applications**
   
   **Detection**: Detect loops with no ending conditions.
   
7. **Recursive Function Calls**: Functions that do not terminate and consume stack space leading to stack overflow.
   ```csharp
   // Example of uncontrolled recursion
   public void RecursiveFunction(int value)
   {
       if (value <= 0) return;
       RecursiveFunction(value - 1);
   }
   ```
   
   **Framework: All C# applications**
   
   **Detection**: Identify recursive function calls without proper base cases or termination conditions.
   
8. **Improper Use of Tasks and Async/Await**: Incorrectly managing async operations that lead to unbounded task creation.
   ```csharp
   // Example of creating unbounded tasks
   public async Task ProcessRequestsAsync()
   {
       var tasks = new List<Task>();
       for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++)
       {
           tasks.Add(Task.Run(() => DoWorkAsync()));
       }
       await Task.WhenAll(tasks);
   }
   
   private async Task DoWorkAsync()
   {
       await Task.Delay(1000); // Simulate some async work
   }
   ```
   
   **Framework: ASP.NET Core**
   
   **Detection**: Look for large loops creating tasks without any control over the total number of concurrent tasks.

### Writing SAST Rules
When writing SAST rules to detect Uncontrolled Resource Consumption vulnerabilities, aim for precision to limit false positives. Here are some general guidelines:

- **Memory Allocation**: Check for large memory allocations without disposal or within loops.
- **Thread Management**: Identify excessive creation of threads, especially within loops or in response to user input.
- **Resource Management**: Detect instances of resources (files, network connections) not being properly disposed of using `using` statements or `Dispose` methods.
- **Complex Iterations and Recursion**: Look for deep recursion or iterations over large data sets that are complex and resource-intensive.
- **Session Data**: Monitor storage of large objects in session variables, especially within web applications.
- **Asynchronous Operations**: Track unbounded task creation without any form of throttling or limits.

By focusing on these areas, SAST tools can effectively reduce the risk of resource consumption vulnerabilities while maintaining a low false positive rate.

### Summary and Conclusion
Uncontrolled Resource Consumption is a critical issue that can lead to denial of service and other performance problems. By understanding the various ways in which it manifests in C# applications across different frameworks, and by writing precise SAST rules to detect these patterns, one can significantly mitigate these risks.
