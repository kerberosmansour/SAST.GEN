# Improper Certificate Validation (CWE-295) in C#

###### Explanation of Improper Certificate Validation

Improper Certificate Validation (CWE-295) refers to a scenario where an application does not properly validate the certificates used in secure communication channels, such as TLS/SSL. This can lead to various security risks including Man-In-The-Middle (MITM) attacks, where an attacker could intercept and alter the communication between the client and server without being detected.

The essential practices for proper certificate validation include:
1. **Validating the Certificate Authority (CA):** Ensuring that the certificate is signed by a trusted CA.
2. **Hostname Verification:** Verifying that the hostname in the certificate matches the hostname of the server.
3. **Expiration Date Check:** Ensuring the certificate is still valid and has not expired.
4. **Certificate Revocation Check:** Verifying the certificate has not been revoked by querying CRLs (Certificate Revocation Lists) or using OCSP (Online Certificate Status Protocol)【4:0†source】.

### Variations in C#

Improper Certificate Validation can manifest in various ways in C# across different frameworks using the .NET environment. Below are some examples:

#### Example 1: Basic HttpClient Certificate Validation Bypass

```csharp
HttpClientHandler handler = new HttpClientHandler()
{
    ServerCertificateCustomValidationCallback = (message, cert, chain, errors) => { return true; }
};
HttpClient client = new HttpClient(handler);
HttpResponseMessage response = await client.GetAsync("https://example.com");
```

#### Example 2: HttpClient with Custom CertificateValidator in .NET Core

```csharp
using System.Net.Http;

public static HttpClient CreateHttpClient()
{
    HttpClientHandler handler = new HttpClientHandler();
    handler.ServerCertificateCustomValidationCallback = 
        HttpClientHandler.DangerousAcceptAnyServerCertificateValidator;
        
    return new HttpClient(handler);
}
```

#### Example 3: Ignoring SSL Certificate Errors in WebClient

```csharp
ServicePointManager.ServerCertificateValidationCallback = (sender, certificate, chain, errors) =>
{
    return true; // Accept all certificates
};
using (WebClient client = new WebClient())
{
    string content = client.DownloadString("https://example.com");
}
```

#### Example 4: TcpClient without Proper SSL Certificate Validation

```csharp
using System.Net.Security;
using System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates;
using System.Net.Sockets;

TcpClient client = new TcpClient("example.com", 443);
SslStream sslStream = new SslStream(client.GetStream(), false,
    new RemoteCertificateValidationCallback((sender, certificate, chain, sslPolicyErrors) => true),
    null);
sslStream.AuthenticateAsClient("example.com");
```

#### Example 5: Ignored SSL Validation in ServicePointManager (Legacy ASP.NET)

```csharp
ServicePointManager.ServerCertificateValidationCallback += 
    (sender, cert, chain, sslPolicyErrors) => true;

// Now all HTTP requests made using classes such as HttpWebRequest will ignore certificate validation errors
HttpWebRequest request = (HttpWebRequest)WebRequest.Create("https://example.com");
HttpWebResponse response = (HttpWebResponse)request.GetResponse();

Console.WriteLine(new StreamReader(response.GetResponseStream()).ReadToEnd());
```

### Best Practices for Secure Certificate Validation

To address the issues of certificate validation in the aforementioned examples, follow these best practices:

1. **Use Default Behaviour:** Rely on the default certificate validation logic provided by the .NET framework.
2. **Specific Custom Validation:** If custom validation is necessary, ensure it correctly performs all required checks (CA validation, hostname verification, expiration and revocation checks).
3. **Avoid Global Callbacks:** Avoid setting global callbacks in `ServicePointManager` as they affect the entire application.
4. **Logging and Monitoring:** Log certificate validation failures for monitoring and alerting to potential security incidents.

### Recommendations for SAST Rule Authoring

When authoring SAST rules for detecting improper certificate validation, focus on the following strategies:

1. **Pattern Matching for Common Pitfalls:** Look for common delegate or lambda expressions that always return true in `ServerCertificateCustomValidationCallback`.
2. **Contextual Analysis:** Ensure that the detection logic can differentiate between test code and production code, reducing false positives.
3. **Highlight Dangerous Methods:** Flag the use of `HttpClientHandler.DangerousAcceptAnyServerCertificateValidator` and similar methods.
4. **Contextual Validation:** Ensure that SSL/TLS related code instances do not ignore validation by excluding global callbacks that override security policies.

By adhering to these principles, you can ensure high accuracy in identifying improper certificate validation issues with minimal false negatives and false positives【4:0†source】   .
