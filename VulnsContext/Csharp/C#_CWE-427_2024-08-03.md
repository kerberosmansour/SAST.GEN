# Uncontrolled Search Path Element (CWE-427) in C#

###### Understanding Uncontrolled Search Path Element

**Uncontrolled Search Path Element** is a type of security vulnerability that occurs when an application relies on the environment's search path to locate executables or libraries but does not control or validate these paths. This can lead to an attacker manipulating the search path to introduce malicious code execution by placing a malicious executable or library earlier in the search path than the intended legitimate executable or library.

### Why It Happens

1. **Use of External Executables**: If the application runs external executables without a fully qualified path.
2. **Dynamic Language Library Loading**: Dynamically loading libraries without specifying exact paths.
3. **Misconfiguration**: Poor configuration of system/application paths that are not adequately secured.

### Consequences

When an application inadvertently executes a malicious executable instead of the legitimate one, it could lead to various consequences, including:
- Unauthorized access
- Data leakage
- System compromise
- Remote code execution

### Writing SAST Detection Rules for Uncontrolled Search Path Element

#### C# Examples and Framework-Specific Considerations

C# applications, particularly when using common frameworks like .NET, ASP.NET, and RESTful services, may exhibit Uncontrolled Search Path Element vulnerabilities in various ways. Below are examples and their contexts that should guide the creation of detection rules for a SAST tool.

#### Example 1: Misconfigured PATH Environment Variable

C# applications often use the `System.Diagnostics.Process` class to start external processes. If the executable path is not controlled, it can lead to vulnerabilities.

```csharp
using System.Diagnostics;

public class Example {
    public void RunProcess() {
        Process.Start("myApplication.exe"); // Vulnerable: Uses environment PATH
    }
}
```

**Rule for SAST:**
Detect the use of `Process.Start` with unqualified executable names.

#### Example 2: Dynamic Library Loading

Dynamic library loading without specifying full paths using P/Invoke can lead to this vulnerability.

```csharp
using System.Runtime.InteropServices;

public class Example {
    [DllImport("MyLibrary.dll")]
    public static extern void MyFunction();

    public void CallFunction() {
        MyFunction(); // Vulnerable: Loads MyLibrary.dll from uncontrolled path
    }
}
```

**Rule for SAST:**
Identify `[DllImport]` attributes without full paths.

#### Example 3: ASP.NET Core Configuration

In ASP.NET Core, improper configuration of paths for loading plugins or modules can also contribute to this issue.

```csharp
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services) {
    services.AddMvc().AddApplicationPart(Assembly.Load(new AssemblyName("MyPlugin"))); // Vulnerable: Unqualified path
}
```

**Rule for SAST:**
Detect Assembly.Load calls without a full path in `ConfigureServices`.

#### Example 4: RESTful Services Improper Handling of Paths

Ensuring RESTful services load configurations or files from safe paths:

```csharp
public class ConfigController : ControllerBase {
    [HttpGet]
    public IActionResult LoadConfig() {
        var configPath = ConfigurationManager.AppSettings["ConfigPath"];
        return Ok(System.IO.File.ReadAllText(configPath)); // Vulnerable if ConfigPath is uncontrolled
    }
}
```

**Rule for SAST:**
Identify file loading operations using paths read from configurations or environment variables without validation.

### Framework-Specific Considerations

- **.NET Core**: Ensure that application parts and plugins are loaded from secure, validated paths.
- **ASP.NET MVC**: Validate that all file operations and external process starts come from a secure, pre-determined path.
- **RESTful Web Services**: Inspect the handling of URL parameters and configurations to ensure any path manipulations are validated.

### Minimizing False Positives and False Negatives

1. **Context-Aware Analysis**: Ensure the rules check the context in which paths are used, including checking for preliminary path validations preceding their use.
2. **Path Sanitization**: Look for common path selection and sanitization functions. If detected, adjust the severity of the finding.
3. **Environment Variables**: Validate environment variable usage concerning paths to ensure they are not influenced by user input without validation.

By using these examples and guidelines, we can create effective SAST rules that identify Uncontrolled Search Path Element vulnerabilities in C# applications with minimal false positives and false negatives. These rules should be carefully designed to inspect how paths are constructed, validated, and used in different contexts across popular frameworks like .NET and ASP.NET.

Consider leveraging this information to provide a robust foundation for your SAST rules, ensuring your tools remain effective and reliable【4:0†source】【4:1†source】【4:2†source】【4:3†source】【4:4†source】【4:5†source】【4:6†source】【4:7†source】【4:8†source】【4:9†source】【4:10†source】【4:11†source】【4:12†source】【4:13†source】【4:14†source】【4:15†source】【4:16†source】【4:17†source】【4:18†source】【4:19†source】.
