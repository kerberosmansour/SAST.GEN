# Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type (CWE-434) in C#

****Unrestricted Upload of Files with Dangerous Types: Overview and Detection in C#**

### Overview

Unrestricted upload of file with dangerous types occurs when a web application or system allows users to upload files without adequate validation, potentially leading to severe security vulnerabilities. Malicious files can exploit vulnerabilities, execute arbitrary code, and compromise the system. Here's a breakdown of the potential risks:

1. **Remote code execution (RCE):** Uploading a file with code that gets executed on the server.
2. **Denial of Service (DoS):** Files like ZIP bombs and XML bombs can exhaust server resources.
3. **Phishing and Social Engineering:** Uploading HTML or other file types for phishing attacks.
4. **Client-side vulnerabilities:** Cross-site scripting (XSS) or Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) through uploaded files【4:0†source】【4:10†source】.

### Common Protections
1. **Extension Validation:** Only allow critical file extensions.
2. **MIME Type Validation:** Check MIME types but do not rely on them solely.
3. **Content Validation:** Checking the file's content against expected patterns.
4. **File Signature Validation**: verifying that the file's magic numbers match the expected type.
5. **Filename Sanitization:** Removing special characters from filenames.
6. **Storage Security:** Store files outside the webroot and use handlers for access.

### Variations in C# and Framework Implementations

#### ASP.NET Core
1. **Basic File Uploads with Feature Validation**
   ```csharp
   [HttpPost]
   public async Task<IActionResult> UploadFile(IFormFile file)
   {
       if (file != null)
       {
           var extension = Path.GetExtension(file.FileName).ToLowerInvariant();
           var allowedExtensions = new[] { ".jpg", ".png", ".pdf" };

           if (!allowedExtensions.Contains(extension))
               return BadRequest("Invalid file type");

           using (var stream = new FileStream(Path.Combine("uploads", file.FileName), FileMode.Create))
           {
               await file.CopyToAsync(stream);
           }
           return Ok("File uploaded successfully");
       }
       return BadRequest("No file uploaded");
   }
   ```
   **SAST Rule**: Check file extension validation and for usage of critical file types in the implementation logic.

2. **MIME Type Validation**
   ```csharp
   [HttpPost]
   public async Task<IActionResult> UploadFile(IFormFile file)
   {
       var allowedMimeTypes = new[] { "image/jpeg", "image/png", "application/pdf" };
       if (!allowedMimeTypes.Contains(file.ContentType))
           return BadRequest("Invalid mime type");

       var filePath = Path.Combine("uploads", file.FileName);
       using (var stream = new FileStream(filePath, FileMode.Create))
       {
           await file.CopyToAsync(stream);
       }
       return Ok("File uploaded successfully");
   }
   ```

#### Azure Functions
1. **Function Binding with Extension and Size Check**
   ```csharp
   public static async Task<IActionResult> Run(
       [HttpTrigger(AuthorizationLevel.Function, "post", Route = null)] HttpRequest req,
       ILogger log)
   {
       var file = req.Form.Files["file"];
       var allowedExtensions = new[] { ".jpg", ".png", ".pdf" };

       if (file == null || !allowedExtensions.Contains(Path.GetExtension(file.FileName).ToLowerInvariant()))
           return new BadRequestObjectResult("Invalid file");

       var savePath = Path.Combine(Path.GetTempPath(), file.FileName);
       using (var stream = new FileStream(savePath, FileMode.Create))
       {
           await file.CopyToAsync(stream);
       }
       return new OkObjectResult("File uploaded successfully");
   }
   ```

#### Legacy ASP.NET MVC
1. **Files Uploads and Directory Traversal Prevention**
   ```csharp
   [HttpPost]
   public ActionResult Upload(HttpPostedFileBase file)
   {
       if (file != null && file.ContentLength > 0)
       {
           var fileName = Path.GetFileName(file.FileName);
           var path = Path.Combine(Server.MapPath("~/App_Data/uploads"), fileName);
           file.SaveAs(path);
       }
       return RedirectToAction("Index");
   }
   ```
   **SAST Rule**: Ensure that user inputs do not affect file paths directly to avoid directory traversal vulnerabilities.

### Key Elements for SAST Rule Creation

1. **Regexp for Common Vulnerabilities**
   - Detect usage of `.SaveAs`, `FileStream`, or similar methods where file paths might be influenced by user inputs.
   - Check for validation logic on file names, extensions, and MIME types.

2. **Identify Critical Bypasses**
   - Verify checks for null bytes, double extensions, and special characters in file names.

3. **Rule Design**
   - **False Positive Reduction:** Ensure rules are contextually aware (e.g., different rules for different frameworks).
   - **False Negative Reduction:** Combine checks for content validation and storage location checks to provide comprehensive coverage.

### Example SAST Rule Pseudo-Logic
```pseudo
rule "upload file extension check"
when
    code contains "FileStream" or "SaveAs"
    and method contains "IFormFile" or "HttpPostedFileBase"
then
    check if file extension is validated against an allowlist
    alert if not found
end
```

By using specific scans for different frameworks and ensuring that all critical points in file upload logic are covered, the SAST tool can achieve high false negative and low false positive rates.【4:0†source】【4:17†source】.
