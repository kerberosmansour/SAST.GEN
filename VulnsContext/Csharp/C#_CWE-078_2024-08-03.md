# Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection') (CWE-078) in C#

###### Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')

**OS Command Injection** is a type of vulnerability in which an application executes an arbitrary command on the host operating system using user-controlled input. This kind of vulnerability arises when the input from a user isn't correctly neutralized, potentially allowing an attacker to execute unintended commands on the system.

#### Example Explanation:
When a user is allowed to input commands that are concatenated into system-level commands without proper validation or sanitization, those inputs can be crafted to execute arbitrary code. For instance, an application might use user input to form shell commands:

```shell
calc
```

However, if an attacker manipulates the input to something like:

```shell
calc & echo "test"
```

Both the `calc` application and the value "test" are executed【4:0†source】.

### Variations of OS Command Injection in C#

Below, I outline various ways OS Command Injection can occur in C#, particularly focusing on different popular frameworks and methodologies to detect them.

#### 1. Using `System.Diagnostics.Process.Start`
A common method to execute commands in C# is through the `System.Diagnostics.Process.Start` method.

**Vulnerable Example**:
```csharp
string userInput = GetUserInput(); // Assume this gets the input from the user
string command = "ping " + userInput;
System.Diagnostics.Process.Start("cmd.exe", command);
```

Here, if `userInput` is `& del C:\*.*`, it can delete all files on the C: drive if executed with sufficient privileges.

**Secure Example**: 
```csharp
string userInput = GetUserInput();
string command = $"ping {userInput}";
System.Diagnostics.Process process = new System.Diagnostics.Process();
process.StartInfo.FileName = "cmd.exe";
process.StartInfo.Arguments = "/c " + command;
process.StartInfo.UseShellExecute = false;
process.StartInfo.RedirectStandardOutput = true;
process.Start();
string result = process.StandardOutput.ReadToEnd();
process.WaitForExit();
```

#### 2. In Web Applications (ASP.NET MVC / ASP.NET Core)
When dealing with file uploads, command execution vulnerabilities can arise.

**Vulnerable Example**:
```csharp
[HttpPost]
public IActionResult UploadFile(IFormFile file)
{
    var filePath = Path.GetTempPath() + file.FileName;
    using (var stream = new FileStream(filePath, FileMode.Create))
    {
        file.CopyTo(stream);
    }
    System.Diagnostics.Process.Start("/usr/bin/convert", $"{filePath} {filePath}.png");
    return Ok();
}
```

**Secure Example**:
```csharp
[HttpPost]
public IActionResult UploadFile(IFormFile file)
{
    var filePath = Path.GetTempPath() + Path.GetFileName(file.FileName);
    using (var stream = new FileStream(filePath, FileMode.Create))
    {
        file.CopyTo(stream);
    }
    var processInfo = new System.Diagnostics.ProcessStartInfo
    {
        FileName = "/usr/bin/convert",
        Arguments = $"{filePath} {filePath}.png",
        RedirectStandardOutput = true,
        UseShellExecute = false
    };
    System.Diagnostics.Process.Start(processInfo);
    return Ok();
}
```

#### 3. Using Third-Party Libraries
When using third-party libraries that interface with the OS, ensure parameters supplied are sanitized.

**Example with `Renci.SshNet`**:
```csharp
using (var client = new SshClient("example.com", "username", "password"))
{
    client.Connect();
    var command = client.CreateCommand($"ls {userInput}");
    var result = command.Execute();
    Console.WriteLine(result);
    client.Disconnect();
}
```

#### SAST Rule Recommendations

To create an effective Static Application Security Testing (SAST) rule to detect OS Command Injections in C#:

1. **Pattern Matching for Vulnerable Method Calls**:
   - Identify usages of `System.Diagnostics.Process.Start` and similar methods.
   - Check for dynamic concatenation of user input or variables with the command string.

2. **Data Flow Analysis**:
   - Trace the source of input into command execution functions.
   - Determine if user inputs are sanitized, e.g. using whitelisting or proper escaping mechanisms.

3. **Framework Specific Checks**:
   - For ASP.NET Core, track `IFormFile` uploads and their usage.
   - Check if paths and filenames are sanitized and validated.

4. **Third-Party Libraries**:
   - Identify methods commonly used to execute system commands through third-party libraries (like `Renci.SshNet`).
   - Verify inputs to these methods against whitelisting and escaping practices.

By following these recommendations, SAST rules can be created to detect potential OS Command Injection vulnerabilities with high accuracy and reduced false positives. Proper validation, context-specific sanitization, and avoiding direct command execution with user inputs are key practices to mitigate these risks.
