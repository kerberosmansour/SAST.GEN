# Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following') (CWE-059) in C#

###### Explanation of Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')

**Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')**, classified as CWE-59, refers to a vulnerability where software improperly resolves symbolic or hard links before accessing a file. This can lead to security risks such as unauthorized file access or manipulation. The issue often arises when an application does not adequately validate or handle symbolic links, potentially allowing an attacker to redirect file accesses to unintended locations. This vulnerability is an instance of the broader category of Path Traversal vulnerabilities. For more details, please refer to the [CWE-59 documentation](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/59.html).

### Attack Scenarios
1. **Scenario #1**:
   A malicious user creates a symbolic link in a location that they can control, which points to a sensitive system file. When the application follows this link, it inadvertently accesses the sensitive file.

2. **Scenario #2**:
   An attacker might replace a temporary file or log file with a symbolic link to another critical system file. When the application attempts to read from or write to this file, it reads from or writes to the linked sensitive file instead.

## Variations in C# and Popular Frameworks

When discussing C# and common frameworks, three main contexts should be considered: accessing the file system directly through .NET libraries, web applications using ASP.NET, and specific CMS or development frameworks that encapsulate file operations.

### Direct Use of .NET Libraries

#### Example 1: Using `File.Open` with Symbolic Links

```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        // Path may be manipulated to point to a symbolic link
        string path = "/path/to/file";
        
        // Improper link resolution vulnerability
        using (FileStream fs = File.Open(path, FileMode.Open))
        {
            // File operations...
        }
    }
}
```

### ASP.NET Web Applications

#### Example 2: File Uploads and Access

```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;

public class FileController : Controller
{
    [HttpPost]
    public IActionResult UploadFile(IFormFile file)
    {
        var path = Path.Combine(Directory.GetCurrentDirectory(), "uploads", file.FileName);

        using (var stream = new FileStream(path, FileMode.Create))
        {
            file.CopyTo(stream);
        }
        
        // A symbolic link could be uploaded and then accessed, creating a security risk
        byte[] fileContent = System.IO.File.ReadAllBytes(path);
        
        return Ok();
    }
}
```

### Using Framework-Specific Methods

#### Example 3: Entity Framework and Files

```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;

public class MyDbContext : DbContext
{
    public DbSet<FileRecord> Files { get; set; }
    
    public byte[] ReadFile(int fileId)
    {
        var fileRecord = Files.Find(fileId);
        
        // Path retrieved from database may be manipulated
        string path = fileRecord.Path;

        // Potentially following a symbolic link
        return System.IO.File.ReadAllBytes(path);
    }
}

public class FileRecord
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string Path { get; set; }
}
```

### Writing SAST Rules

To create effective SAST rules for detecting Improper Link Resolution Before File Access in C#, consider the following:

1. **File Operations**: Focus on code patterns involving file operations such as `File.Open`, `File.ReadAllBytes`, `FileStream`, and similar methods.
2. **Path Validation**: Any use of file paths that are formulated using user input, database records, or external sources should be thoroughly reviewed. Consider implementing checks for symbolic links and implementing canonicalization.
3. **Framework-Specific Methods**: Pay attention to framework-specific file handling methods that could follow links, such as file upload handlers in ASP.NET.

### Conclusion

Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following') can appear in various forms within C# and different frameworks, primarily through incorrect handling of file paths that may involve symbolic links. Given the examples and scenarios discussed, a good SAST rule should:
1. Identify file operations involving external data.
2. Flag instances where paths are used without proper validation.
3. Recommend or enforce best practices for secure file handling.

By focusing on these principles, the SAST rules can achieve high coverage (low false negatives) and maintain precision (low false positives)【4:0†source】【4:1†source】【4:2†source】【4:3†source】【4:4†source】【4:5†source】【4:6†source】【4:7†source】【4:8†source】【4:9†source】【4:10†source】【4:11†source】【4:12†source】【4:13†source】【4:14†source】.
