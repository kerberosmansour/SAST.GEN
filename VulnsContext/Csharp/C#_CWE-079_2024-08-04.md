# Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') (CWE-079) in C#

ImproImproper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation, commonly known as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), is a security vulnerability occurring when an application includes untrusted data in a web page without proper validation or escaping. This allows attackers to execute scripts in the user's browser, potentially leading to unauthorized actions or data exposure. According to the Common Weakness Enumeration, this issue is listed under CWE-79【4:0†source】   .

### C# Variations
In C# and popular frameworks like ASP.NET and ASP.NET Core, XSS vulnerabilities predominantly stem from improper handling of user inputs. Here are several examples illustrating different XSS scenarios in C#:

#### 1. Basic Reflection XSS
**Example:**
```csharp
// Vulnerable code
public IActionResult Index(string input)
{
    ViewBag.UserInput = input;  // Directly uses the input in the HTML
    return View();
}
```
If `input` contains a script tag, it will be reflected and executed in the user's browser.

#### 2. Stored XSS with Entity Framework
**Example:**
```csharp
// Vulnerable code
public IActionResult Create(Comment comment)
{
    _context.Comments.Add(comment);
    _context.SaveChanges();
    return RedirectToAction("Index");
}

public IActionResult DisplayComments()
{
    var comments = _context.Comments.ToList();
    return View(comments);  // Displays comments without sanitization
}
```
If the `comment` contains script tags, they will be stored in the database and executed when displayed on the page.

#### 3. DOM-based XSS
In ASP.NET MVC applications, dynamic scripts generated from untrusted data can lead to DOM-based XSS.
**Example:**
```html
<!-- Vulnerable code -->
<script>
    var userInput = '@ViewBag.UserInput';
    document.write(userInput);  // Directly writes user input to the DOM
</script>
```
If `@ViewBag.UserInput` contains a script, it will be executed in the user’s browser.

### Mitigation Techniques
1. **Encoding Output:**
   Use HTML encoding to ensure that user input is not interpreted as HTML or JavaScript. ASP.NET provides built-in encoding mechanisms:
   ```csharp
   @Html.Encode(ViewBag.UserInput)
   ```
2. **Input Validation:**
   Validate inputs strictly on the server-side before processing or storing them.
3. **Use Security Libraries:**
   ASP.NET Core provides data protection services and anti-forgery tokens by default, which can also help mitigate XSS attacks.

### Writing SAST Rules
To write SAST rules for detecting XSS in C#, here are key patterns to look for:

1. **Unencoded Output:**
   Identify code where user inputs are directly included in the HTML output without encoding:
   ```regex
   ViewBag\.\w+\s*=\s*[^\n]+;\s*return\s*View\(\);
   ```
   
2. **Database Operations:**
   Detect when user input is stored and later reflected without sanitization:
   ```regex
   _context\.\w+\.Add\([\w\.]+\);\s*_context\.SaveChanges\(\);
   ```

3. **Inline Scripts:**
   Look for inline script tags that include untrusted data:
   ```regex
   <script>[\s\S]*?@ViewBag\.\w+[\s\S]*?<\/script>
   ```

By leveraging these strategies, your SAST tool can minimize false positives and effectively detect potential XSS vulnerabilities in C# applications.

### Conclusion
Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') is a critical vulnerability that needs careful sanitization and encoding of user inputs. In C# applications, particularly those using ASP.NET frameworks, ensuring that user inputs are handled securely is paramount for preventing XSS attacks【4:0†source】   .
