# Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling (CWE-770) in C#

###### Explanation of Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling
Allocation of resources without limits or throttling refers to a situation where a system or application allocates computing resources to processes, threads, sessions, or tasks without imposing any restrictions or limits. This can easily lead to resource exhaustion, where the system runs out of critical resources such as memory, CPU, disk space, or network bandwidth. This state can make the system unresponsive, slow, or even crash, effectively creating a denial of service (DoS) scenario.

### Key Points Covered in the Provided Files
The attached documentation emphasizes different approaches to prevent resource exhaustion. Here are some key points:

1. **Limit Server-Side Session Time and Session Bound Information Storage**:
   - Limit sessions based on inactivity and final timeout.
   - Reduce the data linked to a session  .

2. **Input Validation**:
   - Limit file upload size and allowed extensions.
   - Limit total request size.
   - Prevent input-based resource allocation and function/thread interaction  .

3. **Rate Limiting**:
   - Control traffic rate from and to a server/component to prevent overuse by individual users or IPs【4:16†source】【4:18†source】.

4. **Infrastructure and Code Level Throttling**:
   - Set timeouts on HTTP servers, reverse proxies, or load balancers.
   - Perform query cost analysis to assign costs to resolving fields or types and reject high-cost queries【4:14†source】【4:17†source】.

### Variations of Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling in C#
To illustrate to an author of SAST tool detection rules, let's look at common variations in C# across different frameworks, mainly focusing on ASP.NET.

#### 1. Infinite File Uploads
Unrestricted file upload functionalities can lead to resource exhaustion if users are allowed to upload extremely large files or an excessive number of files.

```csharp
[HttpPost]
public IActionResult UploadFiles()
{
    var files = Request.Form.Files;
    foreach (var file in files)
    {
        // No limitation on the file size or number of files
        using var stream = new FileStream(Path.Combine("uploads", file.FileName), FileMode.Create);
        file.CopyTo(stream);
    }

    return Ok();
}
```

#### 2. Unrestricted Loop or Recursive Function
This example shows a service method that can potentially be called in an infinite loop, consuming server resources without any throttling.

```csharp
public async Task<IActionResult> ProcessData(CancellationToken cancellationToken)
{
    while (true)
    {
        // Perform computation-intensive tasks
        DoComputation();
        
        // No checks or breaks leading to potential infinite loop
        if (cancellationToken.IsCancellationRequested)
        {
            break;
        }
    }

    return Ok();
}
```

#### 3. Unrestricted Resource Allocation via User Input
User input directly controlling resource-intensive tasks, like creating multiple threads, can be exploited.

```csharp
public IActionResult StartThreads(int numberOfThreads)
{
    for (int i = 0; i < numberOfThreads; i++)
    {
        // Unrestricted number of threads creation
        Task.Run(() => DoWork());
    }

    return Ok();
}
```

#### 4. Unrestricted Database Queries
Allowing users to submit complex database queries without limits can lead to database resource exhaustion.

```csharp
public IActionResult ExecuteUserQuery(string userQuery)
{
    using var connection = new SqlConnection(_connectionString);
    using var command = new SqlCommand(userQuery, connection);
    connection.Open();
    
    var reader = command.ExecuteReader();
    // Processing the data...
    return Ok();
}
```

### Key Indicators for SAST Tool Detection Rules
The goal here is to minimize false negatives and keep false positives low. Typical indicators include:

1. **Absence of Throttling Mechanisms**:
   - Check for the absence of validation on the size and number of file uploads.
   - Absence of rate limiting (e.g., lack of usage of middleware/extensions like `IServiceCollection.AddRateLimiter`).

2. **Unrestricted Loop Constructs**:
   - Flag infinite loops without break conditions tied to resource constraints or cancellation tokens.

3. **Unchecked User Input**:
   - Flag unchecked inputs controlling resource-intensive operations (e.g., creating threads, performing heavy computations).

4. **Unrestricted Database Access**:
   - Identify direct passing of user input into database commands without sanitization or complexity checks.

By focusing on such patterns, creating effective SAST rules will aid in detecting resource allocation scenarios that could lead to vulnerabilities, thereby strengthening your application's defenses.
