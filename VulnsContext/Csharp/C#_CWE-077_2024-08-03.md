# Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection') (CWE-077) in C#

###### Understanding Command Injection

**Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')**, or OS command injection, occurs when an application constructs a system shell command using external input without adequately sanitizing or neutralizing potentially malicious special elements. These special elements can completely alter the initially intended command, leading to various levels of unauthorized control over the system.

For instance, here's a simplified example:
```shell
calc
```
When typed in a Windows command prompt, it launches the Calculator application. In contrast, if an attacker manipulates this input:
```shell
calc & echo "test"
```

Then both the Calculator application and a command to print "test" will execute. This modification can be extremely harmful, especially if the process doesn't follow the principle of least privilege.

### Variations of Command Injection in C#

In C# applications, particularly across different popular frameworks, several variations of command injection might occur. Below are some common scenarios and corresponding examples which should be considered while writing Static Application Security Testing (SAST) rules.

#### 1. Direct Execution of Commands

Commands are often executed directly using system functions, posing a direct risk of injection. For example:

**Plain C#:**
```csharp
using System.Diagnostics;

public void RunCommand(string command)
{
    Process.Start("/bin/bash", "-c " + command);
}
```

**ASP.NET:**
```csharp
using System.Diagnostics;
using System.Web;

public void RunCommand(HttpRequest request)
{
    string command = request.QueryString["command"];
    Process.Start("/bin/bash", "-c " + command);
}
```

#### 2. Argument Injection

Injection can occur when user input is interpreted as arguments to existing commands, without proper sanitization:

**Plain C#:**
```csharp
public void GetProcessDetails(string processName)
{
    string command = $"ps aux | grep {processName}";
    Process.Start("/bin/bash", "-c " + command);
}
```

**ASP.NET MVC:**
```csharp
public ActionResult ProcessInfo(string processName)
{
    string command = $"ps aux | grep {processName}";
    Process.Start("/bin/bash", "-c " + command);
    return View();
}
```

#### 3. Chained Commands

Chaining commands using logical operators (`&&`, `||`) based on user input can also lead to severe vulnerabilities:

**Plain C#:**
```csharp
public void ExecuteCommand(string input)
{
    string command = "ls && " + input;
    Process.Start("/bin/bash", "-c " + command);
}
```

**ASP.NET Web API:**
```csharp
public IHttpActionResult Run(string input)
{
    string command = "ls && " + input;
    Process.Start("/bin/bash", "-c " + command);
    return Ok();
}
```

### Writing SAST Rules to Detect Command Injection

To write SAST rules with high false-negative and low false-positive rates, the focus should be on identifying patterns where unsecured input may be used to form command strings. Here are generalized steps to approach this:

1. **Identify Command Execution Functions:** Functions like `Process.Start()`, `System.Diagnostics.Process.Start()`, and other similar invocations should be flagged as potential command injection points.

2. **Trace User Input:** Examine how user input (e.g., form submissions, query string parameters, cookies) flows through the application and into these functions. If any user-controlled input directly or indirectly forms part of the command string, flag it.

3. **Check for Neutralization:** Verify if the input undergoes proper sanitization. Functions like parameters escaping or using predefined safe values for forming commands should be allowed, and their proper usage should be ensured.

4. **Contextual Analysis:** Review the concatenation or interpolation patterns that introduce user input into command strings. Look for logical operators (`&&`, `||`, `;`) and unsafe formats used in command formation.

5. **Framework-Specific Checks:** Leverage framework-specific contexts, such as request parameters in ASP.NET, to enhance detection capabilities.

Example of a simplified SAST rule to detect command injection:
```pseudo
WHEN user_input -> reaches command_execution_function
IF sanitization is_missing OR improperly_handled THEN flag_as_injection
```
