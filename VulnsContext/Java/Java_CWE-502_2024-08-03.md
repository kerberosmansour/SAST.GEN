# Deserialization of Untrusted Data (CWE-502) in Java

###### What is Deserialization of Untrusted Data?

Deserialization is the process of converting byte-stream data back into an object. When untrusted data is deserialized, it can lead to security vulnerabilities such as remote code execution, data breaches, and denial of service attacks. This happens because deserialization mechanisms might instantiate unexpected object types, invoke undesirable methods, or alter the expected structure of data. Deserialization of untrusted data is particularly dangerous because malicious actors can manipulate the serialized byte-streams to carry out their exploits.

### Variations in Java

Different Java frameworks provide serialization and deserialization mechanisms, each with their own set of potential vulnerabilities. Here are a few common examples from popular Java frameworks where deserialization attacks can occur:

1. **Java's Native Serialization:**
    ```java
    ObjectInputStream in = new ObjectInputStream(new FileInputStream("file.ser"));
    Object obj = in.readObject();
    ```

2. **Apache Commons-Collections:**
    Version 3.1 and other older versions of Apache Commons-Collections are known to have deserialization vulnerabilities due to the InvokerTransformer class.
   
    ```java
    Transformer[] transformers = new Transformer[]{
        new ConstantTransformer(Runtime.class),
        new InstantiateTransformer(
            new Class[]{String.class},
            new Object[]{"calc.exe"})
    };
    Transformer transformerChain = new ChainedTransformer(transformers);
    Map map = new HashMap();
    Map transformedMap = TransformedMap.decorate(map, null, transformerChain);
    ```

3. **Spring Framework:**
    Insecure use of `HttpInvokerServiceExporter` can cause deserialization vulnerabilities.
   
    ```java
    @Bean(name = "/example.service")
    public HttpInvokerServiceExporter exampleService() {
        HttpInvokerServiceExporter exporter = new HttpInvokerServiceExporter();
        exporter.setService(exampleServiceImpl());
        exporter.setServiceInterface(ExampleService.class);
        return exporter;
    }
    ```

4. **Hibernate:**
    Hibernate can deserialize untrusted data when loading entities.
   
    ```java
    Session session = sessionFactory.openSession();
    Blob blob = Hibernate.getLobCreator(session).createBlob(serializedObject);
    session.save(blob);
    ```

5. **Jackson:**
    Versions before 2.1.6 of the Jackson Databind library are prone to deserialization attacks.
   
    ```java
    ObjectMapper mapper = new ObjectMapper();
    SimpleModule module = new SimpleModule();
    module.addDeserializer(Result.class, new ResultDeserializer());
    mapper.registerModule(module);
    Result result = mapper.readValue(new File("data.json"), Result.class);
    ```

6. **XStream:**
    Older versions of XStream (before 1.4.17) can deserialize any class if not properly configured.
   
    ```java
    XStream xstream = new XStream();
    xstream.fromXML(xml);
    ```

7. **JAXB:**
    JAXB deserialization can be exploited if untrusted XML is deserialized.
   
    ```java
    JAXBContext context = JAXBContext.newInstance(Foo.class);
    Unmarshaller unmarshaller = context.createUnmarshaller();
    Foo foo = (Foo) unmarshaller.unmarshal(new FileReader("input.xml"));
    ```

### Writing SAST Rules

When creating Static Application Security Testing (SAST) rules to detect deserialization of untrusted data in Java, consider the following points:

1. **Identify Deserialization Methods:**
    - `ObjectInputStream.readObject()`
    - `readObjectNoData()`
    - Any method from libraries known to be vulnerable such as methods in Apache Commons-Collections, Jackson, XStream, and others.

2. **Contextual Analysis:**
    - Track the source of the stream/data being deserialized.
    - Identify whether any input sanitization or validation occurs before deserialization.
    - Highlight use of deprecated or insecure libraries like `XMLDecoder`, versions of `fastjson` below 1.2.68, etc.  .

3. **Framework-Specific Checks:**
    - **Spring:** Look for `HttpInvokerServiceExporter` usage.
    - **Hibernate:** Monitor Blob creation and deserialization.
    - **Jackson:** Ensure that dangerous modules like `JsonDeserializer` that can modify the type are flagged.
    - **XStream:** Check for proper security configurations to prevent arbitrary class loading.

4. **Security Configurations:**
    - Enforce security best practices such as whitelisting allowed types for deserialization.
    - Ensure proper handling of deserialized data to prevent unexpected method invocation or instantiation of arbitrary objects.

5. **Logging and Alerting:**
    - Implement logging for deserialization attempts.
    - Set up alerts for suspicious deserialization activities.

Using these guidelines, you can create robust SAST rules that help detect deserialization vulnerabilities and ensure the security of your Java applications.
