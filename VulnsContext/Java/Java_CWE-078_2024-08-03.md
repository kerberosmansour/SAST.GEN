# Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection') (CWE-078) in Java

ImproImproper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command (commonly referred to as 'OS Command Injection') is a security vulnerability that occurs when a program dynamically constructs and executes a command using user input. If the user input is not properly sanitized or neutralized, an attacker can inject additional commands that the system executes unintendedly, potentially causing unwanted operations such as data theft, system compromise, or execution of malicious code.

### Types and Examples in Java

#### Using `Runtime.exec` or `ProcessBuilder`

Java provides the `Runtime.exec` and `ProcessBuilder` classes to execute system commands. These methods can be susceptible to injection if user inputs are directly passed without proper sanitization.

**Example 1: `Runtime.exec`**

```java
public void runCommand(String filename) {
    try {
        String command = "ls " + filename;
        Runtime.getRuntime().exec(command);
    } catch (IOException e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
    }
}
```

An attacker could exploit this by providing a filename like `"valid.txt; rm -rf /"`. This means the system would run both `ls valid.txt` and `rm -rf /`, hence deleting critical system files.

**Example 2: `ProcessBuilder`**

```java
public void runCommand(String filename) {
    try {
        ProcessBuilder pb = new ProcessBuilder("ls", filename);
        pb.start();
    } catch (IOException e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
    }
}
```

Even though `ProcessBuilder` helps mitigate some risks by separating arguments, improper handling can still cause vulnerabilities if filenames are complex or contain malicious suffixes.

### Variations in popular Java frameworks

**Spring Framework**

Spring allows rich integrations and often commands execution directly or indirectly through user inputs, which must be handled with care.

**Example 3: Handling user input in a Spring controller**

```java
@RestController
public class CommandController {
    
    @PostMapping("/run")
    public ResponseEntity<Void> runCommand(@RequestBody CommandRequest request) {
        try {
            String command = "ls " + request.getFilename();
            Runtime.getRuntime().exec(command);
            return ResponseEntity.ok().build();
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
            return ResponseEntity.status(HttpStatus.INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR).build();
        }
    }
}
```

**Apache Struts**

Older versions of Apache Struts have had known vulnerabilities where unsanitized parameters could be passed to command executions, making it critical to handle these securely.

**Example 4: Command Injection via Apache Struts**

```java
public class ExecuteAction extends Action {

    public ActionForward execute(ActionMapping mapping, ActionForm form,
            HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) 
            throws Exception {
        
        String cmd = request.getParameter("cmd");
        Runtime.getRuntime().exec(cmd);
        return mapping.findForward("success");
    }
}
```

### Defending against OS Command Injection

1. **Avoid Direct OS Commands**: Use Java APIs for intended functions. For instance, use Java's `File` library for file operations instead of `ls`.
2. **Sanitize Inputs**: Properly sanitize and validate user inputs before using them in command execution.
3. **Use Library Features**: Utilize built-in methods for safely executing commands without exposing to injections. Tools like Apache Commons Exec can provide safer command execution facilities.

### Automated Detection for SAST Tools

A rule for detecting OS Command Injection could involve:
1. Identifying instances where `Runtime.exec` and `ProcessBuilder` are called.
2. Checking if the arguments passed include any form of user input directly or indirectly.
3. Verifying if proper sanitization/neutralization has been applied to the inputs.

For example, a pattern:
```java
Pattern pattern = Pattern.compile(
    "(Runtime\\.getRuntime\\(\\)\\.exec|new\\s+ProcessBuilder)\\((.*)\\)",
    Pattern.CASE_INSENSITIVE | Pattern.DOTALL
);
```

This could be enhanced to verify the sources of the arguments and ensure any user-controlled input is properly handled before being used in command execution.

Building comprehensive automated rules requires combining static analysis patterns with contextual dataflows to determine if any input is tainted and reaches a sink (e.g., command execution) without proper sanitization.
