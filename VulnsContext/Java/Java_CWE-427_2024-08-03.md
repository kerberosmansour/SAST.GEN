# Uncontrolled Search Path Element (CWE-427) in Java

###### What is Uncontrolled Search Path Element?

**Uncontrolled Search Path Element** is a vulnerability that occurs when a program uses an insecure or unchecked directory path to search and load executables or libraries. The vulnerability typically arises when an application constructs a path using an unsanitized user input, leading to execution of potentially malicious executables. This kind of vulnerability can be found in various levels of software, including OS-level scripts, CI/CD pipelines, and application-level libraries.

The primary risk related to uncontrolled search path elements is that attackers can manipulate the path to load malicious libraries or executables, gaining unauthorized access or control over the system. This is classified under CWE-426 (Untrusted Search Path)【4:4†source】.

### Variations and Examples in Java

In Java, Uncontrolled Search Path Element flaws can manifest in multiple ways. Let's discuss the variations and give examples, especially considering popular frameworks:

#### 1. **Class Path Manipulation**

In Java, sometimes paths are constructed dynamically using unsanitized input which can lead to untrusted paths being included in the classpath, allowing unauthorized code execution.

**Example:**
```java
String dir = System.getProperty("user.dir");
String classPath = dir + File.separator + request.getParameter("path");
URL[] urls = {new URL(classPath)};
URLClassLoader classLoader = new URLClassLoader(urls);
Class loadedClass = classLoader.loadClass("MyClass");
loadedClass.newInstance();
```
**Explanation:**
If the `path` parameter is manipulated to include a directory that contains a malicious `MyClass`, then the malicious class will be loaded and executed.

#### 2. **Library Path Manipulation**

Manipulating the java.library.path with untrusted input can result in loading malicious native libraries (DLLs in Windows, .so in Unix/Linux).

**Example:**
```java
String libPath = request.getParameter("libPath");
System.setProperty("java.library.path", libPath);
System.loadLibrary("nativeLib");
```
**Explanation:**
An attacker can specify a `libPath` storing a malicious native library, leading to execution of harmful code.

#### 3. **Common Framework Misconfigurations**

**Spring Framework:**
In Spring applications, if class paths or resource paths are dynamically set without sanitization, it can lead to loading untrusted resources.

```java
@Value("${external.config.path}")
private String configPath;

public void loadExternalConfig() {
    Path path = Paths.get(configPath, "config.xml");
    byte[] fileBytes = Files.readAllBytes(path);
    // process fileBytes
}
```
**Explanation:**
If `external.config.path` is attacker-controlled, it can point to an untrusted directory.

**Apache Struts:**
Path traversal vulnerabilities in Struts can allow untrusted directory access.

```java
public String loadResource() {
    String resourcePath = request.getParameter("resource");
    Path path = Paths.get("/app/resources/", resourcePath);
    byte[] fileBytes = Files.readAllBytes(path);
    // process fileBytes
}
```
**Explanation:**
If `resource` parameter is manipulated, it can traverse directories and access sensitive files.

#### 4. **Improper File Handling**

Java applications sometimes use input to locate files on the system, leading to insecure file access when improperly handled.

**Example:**
```java
String jarFilePath = request.getParameter("jarFile");
File file = new File(jarFilePath);
FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream(file);
JarInputStream jis = new JarInputStream(fis);
JarEntry entry;
while ((entry = jis.getNextJarEntry()) != null) {
    // process the JAR entries
}
```
**Explanation:**
If `jarFile` parameter points to an untrusted JAR file, this can lead to untrusted code being loaded.

### Creating SAST Detection Rules

For SAST tools, rules should focus on detecting any dynamic construction of paths, especially those involving user input. Here are key aspects to include in the rule logic:

- **Path construction methods**: Detect any uses of methods like `File.separator`, `Paths.get()`, `System.setProperty()`, that concatenate inputs to create paths.
- **Parameter sources**: Mark parameter sources that can be controlled by users, such as `request.getParameter()`, `System.getProperty()`, `System.getenv()`.
- **Class Loaders**: Identify creation and use of `URLClassLoader`, `ClassLoader.loadClass()`, and other dynamic class loading mechanisms.
- **Library Loaders**: Identify calls to `System.loadLibrary()`, `Runtime.getRuntime().loadLibrary()`, passing user-controlled values.
- **Common Framework Configurations**: Look for configurations in popular frameworks (e.g., Spring's `@Value`, Struts' action methods) that use user-submitted paths.

### Example SAST Rule in Pseudocode

```plaintext
rule UncontrolledSearchPathElement {
    when
        call to any_method([path_construction_methods]) with (argument sourced_from [source_methods])
    then
        report "Uncontrolled Search Path Element detected: Possible untrusted path constructed and used."
}
```

Replace placeholders like `[path_construction_methods]` with actual method names like `new File()`, `Paths.get()`, etc., and `[source_methods]` with methods like `request.getParameter()`, etc.

### Conclusion

Effective detection of Uncontrolled Search Path Elements requires inspecting how paths are dynamically constructed, especially paths that include user input. Proper sanitization and validation of these paths are crucial to mitigating the risk. Craft SAST rules to catch unsafe constructions and guide developers towards secure coding practices.
