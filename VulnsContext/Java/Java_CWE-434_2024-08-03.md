# Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type (CWE-434) in Java

###### Understanding Unrestricted File Upload of File with Dangerous Type

**Unrestricted File Upload of File with Dangerous Type** occurs when an application accepts files from users without proper validation and restriction, potentially allowing attackers to upload and execute malicious files. This vulnerability may lead to various attacks, such as remote code execution, cross-site scripting, phishing, and denial of service.

The fundamental problem lies in the failure to validate and sanitize the uploaded file's content, type, and name. Typically, attackers might leverage this vulnerability by renaming executable files with harmless extensions (.jpg, .png), injecting scripts or malicious content within trusted file types, or exploiting server configuration.

### Common Variations in Java and Popular Frameworks

Detecting unrestricted file upload issues in Java applications involves understanding various frameworks and their approaches to handling file uploads. Here's an extensive look at different scenarios and examples from popular frameworks.

#### 1. Basic Servlet Example
**Unrestricted Upload of Executable**
```java
@WebServlet("/upload")
@MultipartConfig
public class UploadServlet extends HttpServlet {
    protected void doPost(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException {
        Part filePart = request.getPart("file");
        String fileName = Paths.get(filePart.getSubmittedFileName()).getFileName().toString();
        InputStream fileContent = filePart.getInputStream();

        // No validation on file type
        File uploads = new File("/uploads");
        File file = new File(uploads, fileName);

        try (InputStream input = fileContent) {
            Files.copy(input, file.toPath());
        }
    }
}
```
*Issues*:
- No check on file type or extension; a user could upload executable files or scripts.

#### 2. Spring MVC Example
**Unrestricted Upload with MIME-Type Bypass**
```java
@Controller
public class FileUploadController {

    @PostMapping("/upload")
    public String handleFileUpload(@RequestParam("file") MultipartFile file) throws IOException {
        byte[] bytes = file.getBytes();
        Path path = Paths.get("/uploads/" + file.getOriginalFilename());
        Files.write(path, bytes);

        System.out.println("File uploaded with name " + file.getOriginalFilename());
        return "uploadSuccess";
    }
}
```
*Issues*:
- No check on MIME type or file signature; only relying on original filename, which can be spoofed.

#### 3. Struts2 Example
**Unrestricted Upload with Filename Manipulation**
```java
public class FileUploadAction extends ActionSupport {
    private File upload;
    private String uploadContentType;
    private String uploadFileName;

    public String execute() throws Exception {
        String filePath = ServletActionContext.getServletContext().getRealPath("/");
        File fileToCreate = new File(filePath + "/" + this.uploadFileName);
        FileUtils.copyFile(this.upload, fileToCreate);

        return SUCCESS;
    }
}
```
*Issues*:
- Directly uses uploadFileName without validation, leading to potential attacks with special characters or extensions.

### Examples for SAST Rule Detection

A SAST tool aiming to detect unrestricted file upload vulnerabilities should look for patterns and practices known to introduce these risks. Here are a few generalizable rules:

1. **Check for MultipartFile or Part Usage Without Validation**:
   - Identify usages of `MultipartFile` (Spring) or `Part` (Servlet) where extensions or content types are not checked.

2. **Inspection of File Extensions**:
   - Look for places where uploaded filename (`getOriginalFilename`, `getSubmittedFileName`) is not sanitized or validated against an allowed extensions list.

3. **MIME Type Validation**:
   - Ensure that MIME type (`getContentType`) is validated against a known list of safe types. Check places where MIME type is obtained from the user request without validation.

4. **File Signature Verification**:
   - Detect the absence of file signature verification logic, even if MIME type is validated. Match byte patterns against expected file signatures.

### Practical SAST Rules Examples
**Example Rule 1**:
```regex
(Part|MultipartFile)\s+\w+\s*=\s*request\.getPart\(.+\)\s*;\s*//\s*No\s*validation\s*on\s*extension
```
*Explanation*: This rule looks for requests of file parts without following it with validation logic.

**Example Rule 2**:
```regex
uploadFileName\s*=\s*Paths\.get\(\w+\.getSubmittedFileName\(\)\)\.getFileName\(\)\.toString\(\)\;
```
*Explanation*: Identifies filenames obtained directly from uploaded content without sanitization.

**Example Rule 3 (Spring MVC)**:
```regex
MultipartFile upload\s*=\s*\w+\.getBytes\(\)\;\s+(?!.*allowedExtensions)
```
*Explanation*: Ensures the Spring MultipartFile upload bytes are followed by extension validation logic.

### Summary

Sherif Mansour, unrestricted file uploads are a significant security risk that may allow attackers to execute malicious code or store harmful files on your system. By establishing robust detection rules within your SAST tool, you can help identify vulnerabilities before they are exploited, enhancing the overall security of applications developed using Java and various frameworks【4:0†source】.
