# Access of Resource Using Incompatible Type ('Type Confusion') (CWE-843) in Java

###### Overview of Access of Resource Using Incompatible Type ('Type Confusion')

Access of Resource Using Incompatible Type, commonly referred to as 'Type Confusion,' occurs when software processes data using an incorrect or unexpected type. This can lead to undefined behavior, potential crashes, and even security vulnerabilities. The issue arises because the software incorrectly assumes the data type compatibility of the resource being accessed. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation and examples in Java, with potential scenarios for the SAST tool to detect.

### Detailed Explanation

Type Confusion vulnerabilities can occur when:
1. **Incorrect Type Casting**: When data or objects are cast to a type that is incompatible, leading to unexpected behavior.
2. **Misuse of Serialization/Deserialization**: When serialized data is deserialized into an incorrect type.
3. **Inappropriate Use of Reflection**: When reflection is used to manipulate objects that are not of the correct expected type.
4. **Unsafe Use of Generic Types**: When generic types are used without proper type safety checks.

### General Cases in Java

#### 1. Incorrect Type Casting

Type casting without proper checks is a common source of type confusion:
```java
Object someObject = "Just a string";
Integer integerObject = (Integer) someObject; // This will cause a ClassCastException
```

#### 2. Unsafe Deserialization

Deserialization of data can also cause type confusion if not handled properly:
```java
ByteArrayInputStream byteStream = new ByteArrayInputStream(serializedData);
ObjectInputStream objectStream = new ObjectInputStream(byteStream);
SomeType obj = (SomeType) objectStream.readObject(); // Unsafe cast, needs proper checks
```

#### 3. Reflection Misuse

Reflection gives access to private class members, but incorrect usage leads to type-confusion problems:
```java
Field field = SomeClass.class.getDeclaredField("someField");
field.setAccessible(true);
field.setInt(someInstance, 1234); // If someField is not an int, this causes an issue 
```

### Java Framework Specific Examples

**Spring Framework: Handling Request Parameters**

Spring MVC can auto-bind request parameters to method arguments. This auto-binding can lead to type confusion:
```java
@RequestMapping(value = "/user", method = RequestMethod.POST)
public String createUser(@RequestParam("age") int age) {
  // If age parameter is not an int, it will cause an exception
}
```
**Detection:** SAST tools should check the data validation and conversion logic for request parameters.

**Hibernate: Query Parameter Binding**

In Hibernate, assigning query parameters without type checks can lead to incorrect type assignment:
```java
Query query = session.createQuery("FROM User WHERE id = :id");
query.setParameter("id", "stringInsteadOfInt"); // If id is an int, this causes an issue
```
**Detection:** Ensure the parameter types match the expected types in the query.

**Apache Commons Collections: Deserialization**

Using a vulnerable version of libraries for deserialization can cause type confusion:
```java
public class DeserializeExample {
  public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException, ClassNotFoundException {
    byte[] byteArray = ... // some byte array
    ObjectInputStream in = new ObjectInputStream(new ByteArrayInputStream(byteArray));
    Object obj = in.readObject(); 
    // Ensure obj is properly type-checked before casting
  }
}
```
**Detection:** SAST should check the use of deserialization methods and the handling of object types post deserialization.

### SAST Rule Development

For a Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tool, type confusion detection rules should focus on:

1. **Casting Checks**: Detect explicit casts that are not type-checked.
   - Example: `(TargetType) obj` where `obj` type does not explicitly match `TargetType`.

2. **Deserialization Context**: Identify deserialization points and ensure that there are checks for the types of these deserialized objects.
   - Example: `Object obj = objectStream.readObject();`

3. **Reflection Usage**: Determine the use of reflection to ensure types are properly verified before any operations.
   - Example: `field.setInt(instance, intValue);`

4. **Generic Type Safety**: Check for the usage of generics to ensure type safety.
   - Example: `List<GenericType> list = new ArrayList<>();`

By focusing on these areas and leveraging these examples, a SAST tool can effectively identify potential type confusion vulnerabilities in Java.
