# Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection') (CWE-089) in Java

****Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')**

### Definition

Improper neutralization of special elements used in an SQL command, commonly referred to as SQL Injection, involves the manipulation of an SQL query in such a manner that it executes unexpected or malicious behavior. This vulnerability occurs when the input provided by a user is not correctly sanitized before being inserted into an SQL statement, allowing an attacker to alter the intended execution of that SQL command.

SQL Injection is classified under [CWE-89](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html). An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to perform various malicious activities, such as:
- Bypassing authentication mechanisms.
- Accessing, modifying, or deleting data.
- Executing administrative operations on the database.
- Sometimes gaining control of the underlying server or executing commands on the operating system.

### Examples in Java

#### 1. Basic Example
The simplest form of SQL injection occurs when user input is directly concatenated into an SQL query.

**Vulnerable Code:**
```java
String userId = request.getParameter("userId");
Statement statement = connection.createStatement();
String sql = "SELECT * FROM Users WHERE UserId = '" + userId + "'";
ResultSet result = statement.executeQuery(sql);
```

In this example, if a user enters `"' OR '1'='1"`, the SQL query becomes:
```sql
SELECT * FROM Users WHERE UserId = '' OR '1'='1'
```
This query will return all rows from the Users table, bypassing the intended logic.

#### 2. SQL Injection via Prepared Statements (Improper handling)
Even prepared statements can be vulnerable if they are used improperly.

**Vulnerable Code:**
```java
String userId = request.getParameter("userId");
String sql = "SELECT * FROM Users WHERE UserId = ?";
PreparedStatement pstmt = connection.prepareStatement(sql);
pstmt.setString(1, userId);
ResultSet rs = pstmt.executeQuery();
```
If the placeholder is used directly without proper validation or handling, SQL Injection can occur.

#### 3. SQL Injection via ORM frameworks (e.g., Hibernate)
ORM frameworks can also be vulnerable, particularly with HQL (Hibernate Query Language).

**Vulnerable Code:**
```java
String userId = request.getParameter("userId");
String hql = "FROM Users WHERE UserId = '" + userId + "'";
Query query = session.createQuery(hql);
List results = query.list();
```
This can be similarly exploited as a normal SQL concatenation.

#### 4. SQL Injection in JPA (Java Persistence API)
Using JPQL (Java Persistence Query Language) improperly can lead to similar vulnerabilities.

**Vulnerable Code:**
```java
String userId = request.getParameter("userId");
String jpql = "SELECT u FROM User u WHERE u.userId = '" + userId + "'";
Query query = entityManager.createQuery(jpql);
List<User> users = query.getResultList();
```

### SAST Rule Considerations

**Detection Strategies:**

1. **String Concatenation in SQL Commands:**
   - Identify patterns where user input is directly concatenated within SQL strings.
   - Look for `Statement` and `createQuery` usages where the SQL string comprises a variable directly.

2. **Improperly Configured Prepared Statements:**
   - Ensure that all variables are set using setter methods (`setString`, `setInt`, etc.).
   - Validate that literals are not passed directly into query placeholders.

3. **ORM Specific Checks:**
   - For Hibernate or JPA, detect dynamic query string constructions using user input.
   - Ensure the use of parameterized queries or query builder methods.

**Example SAST Pseudocode Rule:**

```plaintext
IF method call "createStatement" OR "createQuery"
AND pattern CONCAT(text, user input variable) IN SQL strings
THEN flag as "Potential SQL Injection"

IF method call "prepareStatement"
AND pattern NOT matches regular expression (parameter setting methods sequence)
THEN flag as "Improperly configured Prepared Statement"

IF ORM related library imports
AND query string construction using user input
THEN flag as "Potential ORM SQL Injection"
```
