# Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling (CWE-770) in Swift

###### Understanding Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling

**Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling** refers to the absence of constraints or control mechanisms that ensure optimal distribution and usage of resources. This vulnerability can lead to resource exhaustion, resulting in Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks, poor application performance, and potentially the failure of the entire system. Implementing such controls is crucial to maintaining the availability and responsiveness of applications.

Here are some key points from the provided content:

1. **Session Management**:
   - Limit session time based on inactivity and apply a final timeout to prevent resource exhaustion.
   - Limit the amount of information stored in a session to reduce the burden on web server performance.

2. **Input Validation**:
   - Limit file upload size and types to prevent exhaust of file storage or other web application functions.
   - Limit total request size to make it harder for resource-consuming DoS attacks to succeed.
   - Prevent input-based resource allocation and function/thread interaction, which could otherwise lead to CPU consumption exhaustion.

3. **Network Attacks**:
   - Prevent single points of failure, employ caching, and host static resources on different domains to enhance resilience against bandwidth exhaustion.

4. **Rate Limiting**:
   - Employing rate limiting processes to control traffic rates and prevent DoS scenarios.

### Examples of Resource Allocation Without Limits in Swift

When it comes to Swift programming, especially within popular frameworks like UIKit, SwiftUI, Alamofire, Vapor, etc., examples of resource allocation without limits or throttling span various aspects of application development. Here is a detailed exploration:

#### 1. **Infinite Loops**
An infinite loop can consume CPU resources without bounds:
```swift
while true {
    // Do something indefinitely
}
```

#### 2. **Unbounded Memory Allocation**
Allocating large arrays or data structures without limits:
```swift
var data = [Int]()
for _ in 0..<Int.max {
    data.append(0)
}
```

#### 3. **Network Requests Without Throttling**
Using Alamofire to make unlimited network requests:
```swift
import Alamofire

func makeRequests() {
    while true {
        AF.request("https://example.com").response { response in
            // Handle response
        }
    }
}
```

#### 4. **Unbounded Timer Usage**
Creating a non-stop timer using GCD:
```swift
DispatchQueue.global().async {
    while true {
        DispatchQueue.main.asyncAfter(deadline: .now() + 1) {
            // Execute some code every second without stopping
        }
    }
}
```

#### 5. **Excessive Background Task Execution**
Starting multiple background tasks without limits (Vapor framework):
```swift
import Vapor

func performBackgroundTasks(app: Application) {
    for _ in 0..<100000 {
        app.eventLoopGroup.next().execute {
            // Perform background task
        }
    }
}
```

### Writing SAST Rules to Detect Resource Allocation Issues

Here's a structured way to approach writing SAST (Static Application Security Testing) rules for detecting resource allocation issues:

1. **Identify Infinite Loops**:
   - Search for `while true` or similar constructs.
   - Ensure any loops have conditions that guarantee termination.
   - Rule: Flag all infinite loops unless explicitly marked safe by developers.

2. **Monitor Memory Allocation**:
   - Detect unbounded data structure allocations (`for _ in 0..<Int.max`).
   - Rule: Flag large constant allocations and provide warnings on potential memory overflows.

3. **Throttling Network Requests**:
   - Identify continuous network requests (e.g., usage of Alamofire or URLSession in loops).
   - Rule: Flag unthrottled network request patterns.
   - Ensure there are delays, cancellation points, or retry limits.

4. **Control Timers**:
   - Look for timer-based loops (`DispatchQueue` loops).
   - Rule: Warn about unbounded asynchronous tasks and suggest using a weak reference or cancellation mechanism.

5. **Limit Background Tasks**:
   - Check usages of background task APIs (e.g., Vapor background tasks).
   - Rule: Ensure that background tasks have execution limits or are adequately throttled.

The key to writing effective SAST rules lies in minimizing false positives and negatives. This requires a balance between covering typical unbounded resource allocation patterns and not being overly restrictive.
