# Uncontrolled Search Path Element (CWE-427) in Swift

###### Uncontrolled Search Path Element: Explanation for SAST Rule Authoring

Uncontrolled Search Path Element vulnerabilities occur when applications use search paths that can be influenced by external input, leading to the execution of arbitrary code or the retrieval of dangerous files. This type of vulnerability is commonly associated with several CWE entries:
- **CWE-426**: Untrusted Search Path
- **CWE-427**: Uncontrolled Search Path Element

In the context of Swift, these vulnerabilities can occur through various mechanisms, especially when using different popular frameworks.

#### Key Concepts to Understand:

1. **Dynamic Library Loading**: Using functions that load libraries at runtime based on path strings can introduce vulnerabilities if those paths are not properly controlled.
  
2. **System Path Modifications**: Manipulating environment variables such as `PATH` without proper validation can lead to the execution of malicious code.

3. **File Operations**: Performing file operations (read/write) based on uncontrolled path inputs.

Let's explore these with examples relevant to Swift and popular frameworks:

### Examples in Swift:

#### 1. Using `dlopen`
The `dlopen` function dynamically loads a library into the process. If the path to the library is influenced by user input, this can result in loading and executing an untrusted library.

```swift
import Foundation

// Vulnerable code: user can influence `libraryPath`
let libraryPath = "/usr/local/lib/" + userInput
if let handle = dlopen(libraryPath, RTLD_NOW) {
    // Use the handle
} else {
    print("Failed to load the library.")
}
```
To mitigate this, paths should be validated or specified as constants, ensuring only trusted libraries are loaded.

#### 2. Environment Variables
Manipulating system environment variables without validation can lead to vulnerabilities.

```swift
import Foundation

func setPath() {
    // Vulnerable code: environment variable can be manipulated
    setenv("PATH", userProvidedPath, 1)
    system("ls")
}
```
Validation is essential to ensure the provided path is legitimate and points only to trusted directories.

#### Framework-Specific Examples:

#### 3. Vapor (Server-Side Swift)
Vapor applications may interact with the file system based on user input.

```swift
import Vapor

func fileHandler(req: Request) throws -> Future<Response> {
    let fileName = try req.query.get(String.self, at: "file")
    let filePath = "/uploads/" + fileName
    return req.eventLoop.newSucceededFuture(result: req.fileio.streamFile(at: filePath))
}
```
In the above example, `fileName` is directly appended to the path, potentially allowing path traversal attacks (`../../`). Validating the filename to ensure it does not contain path traversal characters is critical.

### Best Practices for Writing SAST Rules:

1. **Path Validation**: Ensure paths are validated against directory traversal and only allow known good paths or patterns.

2. **Static Paths for Libraries**: Avoid using dynamic paths for loading critical libraries. Hardcode paths to trusted libraries where possible.

3. **Sanitizing Environment Variables**: Any usage of environment variables should be sanitized and validated.

4. **Framework-Specific Checks**: SAST rules should consider common patterns and API usages in popular frameworks like Vapor and SwiftNIO.
