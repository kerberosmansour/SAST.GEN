# Integer Overflow or Wraparound (CWE-190) in Swift

###### Integer Overflow and Wraparound in Swift

#### Explanation:
An **Integer Overflow or Wraparound** occurs when an arithmetic operation exceeds the representable range of the data type. For instance, increasing the maximum value of an integer results in it wrapping around to its minimum value and vice versa. This issue is crucial because it can lead to unexpected behaviors, crashes, or security vulnerabilities.

#### Swift Variations:

1. **Basic Integer Overflow in Swift:**
    ```swift
    var a: Int8 = 127
    a += 1 // Overflow: Value becomes -128
    ```

2. **Unsigned Integer Overflow:**
    ```swift
    var b: UInt8 = 0
    b -= 1 // Underflow: Value becomes 255
    ```

3. **Using Swift's Overflow Operators:**
    - **Addition Overflow (`&+`):**
      ```swift
      var c: UInt8 = 255
      c = c &+ 1 // Result: 0
      ```

    - **Subtraction Overflow (`&-`):**
      ```swift
      var d: UInt8 = 0
      d = d &- 1 // Result: 255
      ```

    - **Multiplication Overflow (`&*`):**
      ```swift
      var e: UInt8 = 128
      e = e &* 2 // Result: 0
      ```

4. **Overflow in Swift's Standard Library (e.g., Foundation):**
    Using classes or methods in Foundation that implicitly cast numbers can cause overflows:

    ```swift
    import Foundation

    let data = NSData(capacity: UInt(Int.max) + 1) // UInt overflow when casting Int.max
    ```

5. **CoreData (Framework Example):**
    When persisting data that involves arithmetic operations on managed objects:

    ```swift
    import CoreData

    class SomeEntity: NSManagedObject {
        @NSManaged var counter: Int16
    }

    func incrementCounter(entity: SomeEntity) {
        entity.counter += 1
        if entity.counter > 32767 { // Int16 max
            entity.counter = -32768 // Wrap around manually
        }
    }
    ```

### SAST Rule Construction for Detection:

To construct SAST rules with high false negative and low false positive rates, the following considerations should be made:

1. **Identify Arithmetic Operations:**
   - Track operations involving `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, and `%` where operands are of integer types (both signed and unsigned).

2. **Type Analysis:**
   - Recognize the type range (e.g., `Int8`, `UInt16`, etc.) and analyze the operations to ensure they do not exceed the bounds.

3. **Library and Framework-Specific Patterns:**
   - Parse through code using popular frameworks like `Foundation`, `CoreData`, and look for types that map to integers and arithmetic manipulations.

4. **Use of Overflow Operators:**
   - Pay close attention to Swift’s overflow operators (`&+`, `&-`, `&*`). These should trigger alerts as they explicitly indicate overflow potential.

#### Example SAST Rule Definition:
```regex
# Detects potential integer overflow conditions in Swift
(\w+)\s*([\+\-\*/])=\s*(\w+)
# Identifies the use of overflow operators (&+, &-, &*)
(\w+)\s*(&[\+\-\*])\s*(\w+)
```

### Conclusion:
Given the provided information, while the fundamental method for detecting integer overflow revolves around recognizing arithmetic operations and type bounds, considering Swift's verbosity in handling numbers via explicit and framework-specific constructs enriches the detection process. Adhering to these strategies should help implement precise SAST rules with fewer false positives and negatives.
