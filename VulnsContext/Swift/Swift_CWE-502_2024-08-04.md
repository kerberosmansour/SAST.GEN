# Deserialization of Untrusted Data (CWE-502) in Swift

###### Deserialization of Untrusted Data

**Deserialization of Untrusted Data** occurs when data structured in some format (commonly JSON, XML, or binary) is processed and converted back into objects. This process can pose severe security risks if the source of this data is not verified, as malicious actors can manipulate the serialized data to perform unauthorized actions. An unvalidated or improperly validated source can lead to the execution of arbitrary code, data corruption, privilege escalation, and other critical security issues.

#### Overview from the Provided Content

Based on the provided documents, deserialization of untrusted data is recognized as a significant software and data integrity failure:

- **Description**: Objects or data serialized into a structure that can be seen and modified by an attacker make it vulnerable to insecure deserialization【4:0†source】 .
- **Examples**: Attackers might exploit deserialized data through techniques like modifying the user state, exploiting signature patterns, and leveraging known vulnerabilities in deserialization libraries to execute remote code  .
- **Prevention**: Using digital signatures, ensuring trusted and vetted data sources, and performing integrity checks to detect tampering【4:0†source】 .

### Deserialization in Swift and Popular Frameworks

To write effective SAST rules that detect deserialization of untrusted data in Swift, it's essential to cover various deserialization methods and libraries commonly used in Swift applications. Below are examples and explanations of different variations of deserialization that could be targets for SAST rules.

#### 1. Native Swift `Codable` for JSON Deserialization

Swift's `Codable` protocol supports serialization and deserialization of data structures. Improper handling of this data can lead to security vulnerabilities.

- **Example**:
```swift
struct User: Codable {
    var id: Int
    var name: String
}

let jsonData = ... // JSON data received from an untrusted source
let decoder = JSONDecoder()
do {
    let user = try decoder.decode(User.self, from: jsonData)
    // Further processing with the `user` object
} catch {
    print("Failed to decode JSON: \(error)")
}
```
- **Potential Issue**: If `jsonData` is from an untrusted source, an attacker might craft the data to exploit deserialization vulnerabilities within the application.

#### 2. Use of External Libraries like `ObjectMapper`

`ObjectMapper` is a popular third-party library used in Swift for object mapping, including serialization and deserialization.

- **Example**:
```swift
import ObjectMapper

class User: Mappable {
    var id: Int?
    var name: String?
    
    required init?(map: Map) {}
    
    func mapping(map: Map) {
        id <- map["id"]
        name <- map["name"]
    }
}

let jsonData = ... // JSON data from an untrusted source
if let user = User(JSONString: jsonData) {
    // Further processing with the `user` object
}
```
- **Potential Issue**: The deserialization process can lead to code injection or data tampering if `jsonData` is manipulated by an attacker.

#### 3. Secure Coding Guidelines

To avoid high false positive rates and maintain high accuracy, the SAST tool should focus on detecting the following patterns:

1. **Deserialization without Validation**:
   - Look for direct assignment of deserialized data to critical objects without validation.
   
2. **Insecure Deserialization Methods**:
   - Include common deserialization methods such as `decode`, `init?(map: Map)`.

3. **Unconstrained Data Sources**:
   - Highlight deserialization of data from network sources (e.g., `URLSession`, `Alamofire`).

4. **Absence of Try-Catch or Error Handling**:
   - Ensure that deserialization operations are wrapped in error handling constructs.

5. **Dynamic Type Deserialization**:
   - Flag instances where type information is dynamically inferred or not well defined, making it easier for attackers to inject harmful payloads.

#### Recommendations for Rule Creation
- **Patterns**: Look for `JSONDecoder().decode`, `JSONString`, `init?(map:)` constructors, and any deserialization utilities from typical network response handlers.
- **Contextual Analysis**: Confirm that the deserialized data is from a potentially unreliable or user-controlled source.
- **Error Handling**: Trigger warnings where deserialization is performed without error handling or validation.

By focusing on these aspects, a SAST tool can help minimize false negatives while avoiding excessive false positives. Incorporating checks for proper validation and error-handling mechanisms around deserialization processes can enhance the robustness of the analysis.

### Conclusion
Deserialization of untrusted data is a critical issue that requires careful validation and context-specific safeguarding techniques. By implementing thorough detection rules, you can significantly reduce the risks associated with insecure deserialization in Swift applications.
