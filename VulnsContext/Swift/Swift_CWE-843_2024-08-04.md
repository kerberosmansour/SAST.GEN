# Access of Resource Using Incompatible Type ('Type Confusion') (CWE-843) in Swift

###### Explanation of Access of Resource Using Incompatible Type ('Type Confusion')

**Access of Resource Using Incompatible Type (Type Confusion)** occurs when a program accesses or manipulates a resource using a type that is incompatible with how the resource is intended to be used. This can lead to various types of vulnerabilities, including memory corruption, information disclosure, and privilege escalation.

In Swift, **Type Confusion** can occur due to the language's strong reliance on type safety. However, interactions with lower-level APIs, unsafe code constructs, and dynamic features can still lead to such vulnerabilities. Here are several scenarios and examples illustrating type confusion in Swift involving different popular frameworks:

### Examples in Swift
1. **Unsafe Pointer Conversion**:
    ```swift
    let anyArray: [Any] = [1, "string", 3.14]
    for item in anyArray {
        if let intPointer = UnsafePointer<Int>(bitPattern: item as! Int) {
            print(intPointer.pointee)
        }
    }
    ```
    In this example, forcing a cast from `Any` to `Int` and then creating an `UnsafePointer` can lead to undefined behavior.

2. **Core Foundation APIs**:
    ```swift
    import Foundation

    let cfString = "Hello, World!" as CFString
    if let cfNumber = cfString as? CFNumber {
        print("Number: \(cfNumber)")
    }
    ```
    Converting a `CFString` to a `CFNumber` directly without proper validation is type confusion. 

3. **Swift Collections with Forced Downcasting**:
    ```swift
    let numbers: [Any] = [1, 2, 3, "string"]
    for num in numbers {
        let intNum = num as! Int
        print(intNum)
    }
    ```
    Forcibly downcasting elements of mixed-type collections can result in runtime crashes due to type mismatch.

### Examples in Popular Frameworks

**UIKit and Foundation**:
1. **User Defaults**:
    ```swift
    let defaults = UserDefaults.standard
    defaults.set(42, forKey: "key")

    if let stringVal = defaults.string(forKey: "key") {
        print(stringVal)
    }
    ```
    Attempting to retrieve a `String` from a `UserDefaults` entry that was stored as an `Int` can lead to runtime errors.

2. **JSON Serialization**:
    ```swift
    let jsonString = """
    {"key": 123}
    """
    let jsonData = jsonString.data(using: .utf8)!
    do {
        if let jsonDict = try JSONSerialization.jsonObject(with: jsonData, options: []) as? [String: String] {
            print(jsonDict["key"])
        }
    } catch {
        print("Failed to parse JSON")
    }
    ```
    Treating JSON keys as specific types without validation leads to type confusion.

**Core Data**:
1. **Attribute Types**:
    ```swift
    let entity = NSEntityDescription.entity(forEntityName: "Person", in: context)!
    let person = NSManagedObject(entity: entity, insertInto: context)
    person.setValue(30, forKey: "name")

    if let name = person.value(forKey: "name") as? String {
        print(name)
    }
    ```
    Assigning an `Int` value to a Core Data attribute with a `String` type can result in data corruption and crashes.

**SwiftUI**:
1. **State with Wrong Type**:
    ```swift
    @State var value: Any = "Initial Value"

    var body: some View {
        Text(value as! Int)
            .onTapGesture {
                value = 42
            }
    }
    ```
    Casting `Any` state property to an incompatible type (`Int` instead of `String`) can cause runtime errors.

### Constructing SAST Rules

When creating SAST (Static Application Security Testing) rules to detect these instances, it's important to cover type casts, unsafe conversions, and interactions with dynamic content.

1. **Detect Forced Type Casts**:
    - Identify occurrences of `as!` and flag mixed-type collections where type assumption can be dangerous.

2. **Unsafe Pointers**:
    - Scan for `UnsafePointer`, `UnsafeMutablePointer`, and related constructs to examine improper casts.

3. **Core Foundation and Bridging**:
    - Track CF types conversion ensuring type compatibility (e.g., `CFString`, `CFNumber` misuse).

4. **Dynamic Type Checks**:
    - Ensure JSON deserialization, user defaults access, and JSON parsing validate types before usage.

**Key aspects for rules**:
- Ensure high accuracy (low false positives) by focusing on explicit casts and pointers.
- Verify dynamic interactions and look for insecure code patterns—detecting unsafe bridging and forced casts.
- Check for common framework usage, particularly UIKit/Foundation/Core Data integration points.

By emphasizing these patterns, the rules can effectively identify potential type confusion instances, minimizing the chance of false negatives, and ensuring comprehensive coverage.
