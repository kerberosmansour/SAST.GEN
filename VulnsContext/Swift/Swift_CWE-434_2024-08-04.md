# Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type (CWE-434) in Swift

###### Explanation of Unrestricted File Upload with Dangerous Type

**Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type** refers to a security vulnerability where an attacker can upload executable files or files containing malicious code to a web application. This practice can lead to various security threats including execution of arbitrary code, data breaches, Denial of Service (DoS) attacks, phishing, and other malicious activities.

### Key Variations and Mitigation Techniques

#### 1. **Double Extension Bypasses**

Attackers can bypass simple extension checks by using double extensions, such as `file.jpg.php`. If the application only checks for `.jpg` at the end of the filename, it might think the file is safe when it is actually a PHP script.

**Mitigation Example in Swift:**
```swift
let fileName = "photo.jpg.php"

// Remove the last extension and check again
let fileExtensionChecked = fileName.deletingPathExtension  // returns "photo.jpg"
if fileExtensionChecked != "photo" {
    throw FileUploadError.invalidFileType
}
```

#### 2. **Null Byte Injection**

If the application uses null bytes in filenames to terminate strings, as in `file.php%00.jpg`, the extension check might be bypassed.

**Mitigation Example in Swift:**
```swift
let fileName = "photo.php\u{00}.jpg"

// Remove null bytes and check extension
let sanitizedFileName = fileName.replacingOccurrences(of: "\u{00}", with: "")
if !sanitizedFileName.hasSuffix(".jpg") {
    throw FileUploadError.invalidFileType
}
```

#### 3. **Content-Type Validation Spoofing**

Attackers can spoof Content-Type headers to bypass MIME-type checks.

**Mitigation Example in Swift:**
Using `MobileCoreServices` to strictly verify MIME types by the actual file content, not just the declared Content-Type:
```swift
import MobileCoreServices

func verifyFile(fileURL: URL) throws {
    let pathExtension = fileURL.pathExtension as CFString
    if let uti = UTTypeCreatePreferredIdentifierForTag(kUTTagClassFilenameExtension, pathExtension, nil)?.takeRetainedValue() {
        if !UTTypeConformsTo(uti, kUTTypeImage) {
            throw FileUploadError.invalidFileType
        }
    } else {
        throw FileUploadError.invalidFileType
    }
}
```

### Popular Swift Frameworks for File Uploads
To provide detection for this vulnerability in various Swift frameworks, here are several ways unrestricted file uploads can manifest:

#### 1. **Using Vapor**

**Code Example:**
```swift
app.post("upload") { req in
    let file = try req.content.decode(File.self)
    let fileName = file.filename.deletingPathExtension + ".png"
    
    guard file.extension == "png" else {
        throw Abort(.unsupportedMediaType)
    }
    
    // Save file with additional security checks
}
```

**Potential Issue:**
- Double extensions or paths in filenames
- MIME-type checks based purely on Content-Type header provided by the client

**Mitigation:**
Explicit check and creation of safe filenames as shown.

#### 2. **Using Kitura**

**Code Example:**
```swift
router.post("/upload") { request, response, next in
    let file = request.files[0]
    let fileName = file.filename.deletingPathExtension + ".jpg"

    guard file.type == "image/jpeg" else {
        response.status(.unsupportedMediaType)
        return
    }

    // Save file with additional security checks
    // ... some code here
}
```

**Potential Issue:**
- Reliance on MIME type headers
- Limited filename validation, could allow traversals and double extensions

**Mitigation:**
Remove potential dangerous extensions and validate using the content.

### Detection Rules For SAST Tools

To create detection rules for a SAST tool, configure the following:

1. **Filename and Path Validation:**
   - Look for code patterns where the file path or filename is directly accepted from user input.
   - Ensure proper sanitization functions, such as removing null bytes, are in place.
   - Ensure confirmation of allowed file extensions only after complete sanitization.

2. **Content-Type and MIME-Type Checks:**
   - Ensure that files are checked using both MIME types through system file libraries and not just header values.
   - Verify usage of system libraries like `MobileCoreServices` for content type checks.

3. **Size and Type Restrictions:**
   - Look for proper boundary checks on file sizes.
   - Detect configuration patterns for allowed file types that are too permissive.

4. **Server-Side Validations:**
   - Confirm the presence of server-side validations, not relying solely on client-side implementations.

### Conclusion

By observing these patterns and variations in code, especially within popular Swift frameworks such as Vapor and Kitura, a SAST tool can reliably detect and flag instances of unrestricted file uploads, while maintaining a balance of low false positives and reducing false negatives.
