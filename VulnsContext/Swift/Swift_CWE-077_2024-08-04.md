# Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection') (CWE-077) in Swift

###### Definition of Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')

Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection') occurs when a software system constructs a command using unsanitized external inputs. This allows the input to contain special characters or elements that can alter the intended command, leading to unintended and often harmful consequences.

For instance, an innocent command to display a file's content can be altered to delete the file system if user input is not properly sanitized.

### Command Injection in Swift

Command injection can occur in Swift when data from user input is incorporated into system commands using methods like `Process` or `NSTask`.

### Example Usage in Swift

Here are several examples of how command injection vulnerabilities can manifest in Swift, particularly when leveraging commonly used frameworks.

#### Example 1: Unsafe Use of `Process`

```swift
import Foundation

let process = Process()
process.executableURL = URL(fileURLWithPath: "/usr/bin/env")
let userInput = "ls"
process.arguments = ["-c", userInput]
try? process.run()
process.waitUntilExit()
```

In this example, if `userInput` is controlled by the user, they could inject additional commands, such as `"; rm -rf /"`.

#### Example 2: Using Shell to Call Commands

```swift
let task = Process()
task.launchPath = "/bin/sh"
task.arguments = ["-c", "ls \(userInput)"]
task.launch()
task.waitUntilExit()
```

Here, if `userInput` is not sanitized, a user could input malicious commands like `"; echo hacked > /tmp/hacked.txt"`.

### Mitigation Strategies

1. **Use Built-in Functions**: Prefer built-in functions over executing system commands directly. For example, FileManager can be used for file manipulations instead of shell commands.
2. **Sanitize Inputs**: Sanitizing and validating any user inputs that may be used in constructing system commands is crucial. Use escaping functions to neutralize special characters.
3. **Limit Command Scope**: Use predefined command options and avoid concatenating user input directly into command strings.

### SAST Detection Rules for Swift

To design SAST rules that detect command injection in Swift, focus on:

1. **Pattern Matching**:
   - Look for use of `Process` or `NSTask` instances where `arguments` are influenced by user input.
   - Identify concatenation of user inputs with command strings (`task.arguments = ["-c", "\(userInput)"]`).

2. **Contexts**:
   - Focus on code segments within View Controllers or any user-facing components that handle user input.
   - Detect direct calls to `/bin/sh`, `/usr/bin/env`, and other shell executables with unsanitized inputs.

3. **Best-Practices Violations**:
   - Flagging use of `launch()` and `run()` methods without intermediary sanitization or validation steps.
   - Highlighting lack of predefined allowed command input values.

### Additional Variation Examples in Popular Swift Frameworks

#### Example in Vapor Framework

```swift
app.post("execute") { req -> String in
    let command = try req.content.get(String.self, at: "command")
    let process = Process()
    process.launchPath = "/bin/sh"
    process.arguments = ["-c", command]
    process.launch()
    process.waitUntilExit()
    return "Command executed"
}
```

#### Example in iOS App

```swift
@IBAction func runShellCommand(_ sender: UIButton) {
    let script = textField.text // Assume this is user input from a UITextField
    let process = Process()
    process.launchPath = "/bin/sh"
    process.arguments = ["-c", script!]
    process.launch()
    process.waitUntilExit()
}
```

### Conclusion

By focusing on the aforementioned detection strategies, SAST tools can effectively identify potential command injection vulnerabilities in Swift applications with minimal false negatives and low false-positive rates. High vigilance around parts of the code that handle user input directly and invoking system commands without proper sanitization is critical.
