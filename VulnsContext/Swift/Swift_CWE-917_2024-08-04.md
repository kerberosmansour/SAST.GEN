# Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an Expression Language Statement ('Expression Language Injection') (CWE-917) in Swift

#### Explanation of Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in an Expression Language Statement ('Expression Language Injection') for SAST Tool Rule Creation

### Definition and Description

Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an Expression Language Statement, commonly known as Expression Language (EL) Injection, occurs when user-supplied input is erroneously included in an expression language statement without proper validation or sanitization. This type of injection allows attackers to manipulate the execution flow of the application by inserting malicious payloads into the expression language, which can lead to unauthorized access, data exposure, or code execution.

The OWASP documentation emphasizes that EL Injection is similar to other forms of injection where the attacker’s input is used directly inside expression language statements used by the application【4:1†source】 .

### Why EL Injection is a Risk

1. **Unauthorized Access:** Attackers can leverage vulnerabilities to access restricted data.
2. **Data Manipulation:** Malicious input can alter query results or disrupt system behavior.
3. **Code Execution:** Particularly damaging if attackers can execute arbitrary code.

### EL Injection in Swift and Popular Frameworks

#### Example 1: Custom Expression Parser

```swift
import Foundation

func evaluateExpression(_ expression: String, with values: [String: Any]) throws -> Any {
    let parsedExpression = expression // Dummy parser that directly uses the input
    // Risky: User input 'expression' is directly passed
    let result = parsedExpression.evaluate(with: values)
    return result
}

// Usage
let userInput = "1 + 1"
do {
    let result = try evaluateExpression(userInput, with: [:])
    print("Result: \(result)")
} catch {
    print("Error: \(error)")
}
```

##### Potential Rule for SAST

- **Pattern:** Look for cases where string inputs from users are directly used in expression parsing or evaluation functions.
- **Logic:** Detect any function that takes user input and passes it directly or indirectly to a custom or external expression evaluator without sanitization.

#### Example 2: Using Swift's `NSPredicate`

```swift
import Foundation

func filterDataWithPredicate(_ userFilter: String) {
    let predicate = NSPredicate(format: userFilter) // Injected predicate format
    let array = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
    let filteredArray = array.filter { predicate.evaluate(with: $0) }
    print(filteredArray)
}

// Usage
let userSuppliedPredicate = "SELF == 'apple'"
filterDataWithPredicate(userSuppliedPredicate)
```

##### Potential Rule for SAST

- **Pattern:** Identify the use of `NSPredicate` creation using user inputs.
- **Logic:** Trigger alerts when user-supplied strings are directly formatted into the predicate.

### Creating a SAST Rule

**Objective:** High false negative and low false positive rates.

**Approach:**

1. **Identify Dangerous Functions:**
   - List functions or methods typically used for expression evaluation (e.g., custom parsers, `NSPredicate`, etc.).

2. **Flag Untrusted Inputs:**
   - Mark points where inputs are received from users, such as network inputs, text fields, or request parameters.

3. **Trace Data Flow:**
   - Trace the flow of data from user input points to the dangerous functions.

4. **Detection Logic:**
   - If user inputs are used directly or concatenated into expressions without intermediate sanitization or validation steps, raise a flag.

### Examples in Other Swift Frameworks

#### SwiftSoup for HTML Parsing
SwiftSoup is used for parsing and manipulating HTML.

```swift
import SwiftSoup

func sanitizeAndParseHTML(_ html: String) throws {
    let cleanHTML = try SwiftSoup.clean(html, Whitelist.basic()) // Use proper whitelisting
    let doc = try SwiftSoup.parse(cleanHTML)
    print(doc)
}

// Usage
let unsafeHTML = "<script>alert('Hacked');</script><p>Paragraph</p>"
try? sanitizeAndParseHTML(unsafeHTML)
```

##### Potential Rule for SAST

- **Pattern:** Detection of HTML parsing without using proper sanitization methods like `SwiftSoup.clean`.
- **Logic:** Ensure that all HTML inputs are sanitized before being parsed.

### Conclusion

By defining SAST rules based on common patterns and specific library uses, it becomes possible to detect improper neutralization of special elements within expression language statements effectively. Each rule should carefully assess data flow and ensure proper sanitization at every stage to maintain high accuracy.
