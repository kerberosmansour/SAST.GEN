# Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection') (CWE-078) in Swift

#### Understanding Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')

### Overview

Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command, commonly known as 'OS Command Injection,' occurs when software constructs a system command based on externally influenced input but does not properly neutralize special elements that can alter the command's meaning. This type of vulnerability allows attackers to execute arbitrary commands on the host operating system, leading to severe consequences like data breaches, privilege escalation, and system compromise.

For example, if an application constructs a command from user input without filtering dangerous characters appropriately, it might allow input such as `calc & echo "test"`, which changes the behavior of the originally intended command (`calc`) by also executing the `echo` command【4:0†source】.

To prevent OS Command Injection, here are some recommended primary defenses:

1. **Avoid Direct OS Command Calls**: Use built-in library functions instead of system commands. For example, use API functions like `FileManager.createDirectory(atPath:withIntermediateDirectories:attributes:)` in Swift instead of calling `mkdir` via the shell.
2. **Escape Special Characters**: Ensure that any user input included in a command is properly escaped to prevent altering the intended command.
3. **Parameterization and Input Validation**: Validate inputs using allow-lists and ensure any command constructed programs use parameterized inputs【4:0†source】【4:1†source】【4:2†source】【4:3†source】【4:4†source】.

### Examples in Swift and Popular Frameworks

#### 1. Basic Command Injection

A straightforward example of command injection in Swift using the `Process` class:

**Vulnerable Code:**
```swift
let userInput = "userProvidedFileName"
let command = "ls \(userInput)"
let process = Process()
process.launchPath = "/bin/sh"
process.arguments = ["-c", command]
process.launch()
```

In this example, if `userInput` contains `; rm -rf /`, the malicious command will be executed.

**Secure Code:**
```swift
let userInput = "userProvidedFileName"
let escapedUserInput = userInput.replacingOccurrences(of: "`", with: "\\`").replacingOccurrences(of: "$", with: "\\$")
let command = "ls \(escapedUserInput)"
let process = Process()
process.launchPath = "/bin/sh"
process.arguments = ["-c", command]
process.launch()
```

#### 2. Using Shell Commands in a Web Framework (Kitura)

Kitura is a popular server-side Swift framework.

**Vulnerable Code:**
```swift
router.get("/execute/:command") { request, response, _ in
    let command = request.parameters["command"] ?? "ls"
    let process = Process()
    process.launchPath = "/bin/sh"
    process.arguments = ["-c", command]
    process.launch()
    process.waitUntilExit()
    response.send("Executed command")
}
```

An attacker could send a request to `/execute/;rm -rf /`, resulting in destructive behavior.

**Secure Code:**
```swift
import Kitura

router.get("/execute/:command") { request, response, _ in
    let command = request.parameters["command"] ?? "ls"
    if !isAllowedCommand(command) {
        response.status(.forbidden).send("Command not allowed")
        return
    }
    let process = Process()
    process.launchPath = "/bin/sh"
    process.arguments = ["-c", command]
    process.launch()
    process.waitUntilExit()
    response.send("Executed command")
}

func isAllowedCommand(_ command: String) -> Bool {
    let allowedCommands = ["ls", "date", "whoami"]
    return allowedCommands.contains(command)
}
```

#### 3. Command Injection through Arguments in a Mobile Application

Using `NSTask` (or `Process` in Swift):

**Vulnerable Code:**
```swift
let userInput = "userInput"
let task = Process()
task.launchPath = "/bin/ls"
task.arguments = ["-l", userInput]
task.launch()
```

**Secure Code:**
```swift
let userInput = "userInput"
let safeInput = userInput.replacingOccurrences(of: "&", with: "\\&").replacingOccurrences(of: ";", with: "\\;")
let task = Process()
task.launchPath = "/bin/ls"
task.arguments = ["-l", safeInput]
task.launch()
```

### Writing Effective SAST Rules

To create Static Application Security Testing (SAST) rules with high precision and low false-positive rates, consider the following strategies:

1. **Identify Dangerous API Calls**: Focus on detecting usages of `Process`, `NSTask`, and other command execution functions.
2. **Check for Argument Construction**: Detect patterns where strings are concatenated into command arguments without proper validation or escaping.
3. **Validation Functions**: Ensure commands are validated against an allow-list of safe values.

**Example SAST Rule**:
```regular_expression
regexp = r'Process\(\).*(launchPath|arguments)'
```

**Additional Filters**:
- Flag any use of `launchPath` or `arguments` in `Process` initialization.
- Further inspect if the arguments are constructed using unvalidated user input.
- Allow-lists and escaping functions should be checked.

By carefully designing these rules and validating the presence of proper defenses, SAST tools can effectively reduce OS Command Injection risks while minimizing false positives     .
