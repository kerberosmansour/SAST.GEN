# Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) (CWE-352) in Swift

###### Understanding Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

**Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)** occurs when a malicious web site, email, blog, instant message, or program tricks an authenticated user's web browser into performing an unwanted action on a trusted site. An authenticated user's browser will automatically include all cookies, including session cookies, in the requests made to the trusted site, leading to potential successful exploitation of CSRF, which then cannot distinguish between legitimate authorized requests and forged authenticated requests【4:0†source】  .

**Key Elements of CSRF:**
- **Attack Vector:** The attack often exploits the authentication of the user on a trusted site, tricking the browser into sending a request to the trusted site that the user did not intend.
- **Impacts:** Actions performed can range from fund transfer, password changes, making unauthorized purchases, to privilege escalation.

### CSRF in Swift Applications

To aid in the development of SAST (Static Application Security Testing) detection rules, we need to understand how CSRF vulnerabilities can occur in Swift applications, especially considering the various popular frameworks used. 

#### 1. **Vapor Framework**
Vapor is a popular web framework for Swift. In Vapor, one common area to look for potential CSRF vulnerabilities is in the handling of form submissions and session management.

- **Example 1: Missing CSRF Token Check**
    ```swift
    func handleSubmit(_ req: Request) async throws -> HTTPStatus {
        guard let name = req.formData?["name"]?.string else {
            throw Abort(.badRequest)
        }
        // No CSRF token and validation
        return .ok
    }
    ```
  
    In this example, the form submission handler does not check for a CSRF token, making it vulnerable to CSRF.

- **Detection Rule:**
    - Check for absence of CSRF token verification logic within form handlers.
    - Pattern to detect: `func handleSubmit(_ req: Request) ` and lack of `req.csrf.verifyToken(...)`.

#### 2. **Kitura Framework**
Kitura is another widely used Swift web framework. CSRF issues could arise if request handlers do not properly validate CSRF tokens.

- **Example 2: No CSRF Token Verification**
    ```swift
    router.post("/submit") { request, response, next in
        if let name = request.body?.asURLEncoded?["name"] {
            // No CSRF token verification here
            response.send("Hello \(name)")
        } else {
            response.status(.badRequest)
        }
        next()
    }
    ```

    This handler listens for POST requests but does not include any CSRF token verification, being susceptible to CSRF attacks.

- **Detection Rule:**
    - Locate form submission endpoints.
    - Identify absence of CSRF token validation within handlers.

### Detailed Detection Strategy and Patterns

To reduce false negatives and false positives, rules should be designed to inspect:
- **Form Handlers:** Ensure checking mechanisms like `req.checkFormToken()` or equivalents exist.
- **Session Management:** Ensure proper handing of session tokens and scopes.
- **HTTP Methods:** Review usage of `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE` methods without CSRF tokens.
  
**Pattern Matching Rules:**
1. **Identify Form Handlers Lacking CSRF Validation**
    - **Pattern:** `router.post("/submit") … `
    - **Validation Check:** Look for absence of `req.csrf.verifyToken(...)` in Vapor or equivalent checks in other frameworks.

2. **Session Management in Handlers**
    - **Pattern:** `func handleSubmit(_ req: Request) ` or similar
    - **Validation Check:** Ensure the tokens used in the session are validated against expected CSRF tokens.

### High-Fidelity Rules for CSRF Detection

- Ensure that the SAST tool inspects for specific CSRF tokens being passed in the headers or body of requests.
- Look for form-related endpoints that do not call CSRF validation functions before handling the request payload.
- Check the framework’s documentation for built-in methods to protect against CSRF and ensure that those methods are utilized correctly.

### Conclusion

By understanding where and how CSRF vulnerabilities can occur in Swift applications, and using this understanding to design detection rules for a SAST tool, developers and security professionals can ensure higher accuracy in identifying potential vulnerabilities with minimized false positives and negatives   .
