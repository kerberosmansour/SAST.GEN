# Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) (CWE-918) in Swift

###### Understanding Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)

**Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) Overview:**

SSRF flaws occur when a web application fetches a remote resource without validating the user-supplied URL. This vulnerability allows attackers to manipulate the server to send crafted requests to unintended destinations, even bypassing firewalls, VPNs, or network ACLs. Attackers can then use SSRF to access internal systems, potentially exposing sensitive information, launching further attacks, or performing actions on behalf of the server in a malicious manner【4:0†source】.

**Prevention Methods:**

1. **Network Layer:**
   - Segment remote resource access functionality into separate networks.
   - Enforce firewall policies or network ACLs to block all but essential intranet traffic.
  
2. **Application Layer:**
   - Sanitize and validate all client-supplied input data.
   - Use an allow list for URL schemas, ports, and destinations.
   - Avoid sending raw responses to clients.
   - Disable HTTP redirections.
   - Monitor URL consistency to prevent DNS rebinding and TOCTOU race conditions【4:15†source】.

### SSRF Variations in Swift with Frameworks

When writing Static Application Security Testing (SAST) rules for SSRF in Swift, one needs to consider various scenarios and the popular frameworks in use. Below are examples drawn from several common frameworks and Swift practices:

1. **Swift with URLSession:**
   ```swift
   import Foundation

   func fetchRemoteResource(url: String) {
       guard let requestURL = URL(string: url) else { return }
       let task = URLSession.shared.dataTask(with: requestURL) { data, response, error in
           guard let data = data, error == nil else { return }
           // Process data
       }
       task.resume()
   }
   ```

2. **Swift with Alamofire:**
   ```swift
   import Alamofire

   func fetchRemoteResource(url: String) {
       Alamofire.request(url).response { response in
           if let data = response.data {
               // Process data
           }
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Swift with HTTP Client Libraries:**
   ```swift
   import HTTPClient

   func fetchRemoteResource(url: String) {
       HTTPClient.request(url) { response in
           switch response {
           case .success(let data):
               // Process data
           case .failure(let error):
               // Handle error
           }
       }
   }
   ```

### Key Points for SAST Rule Construction:

1. **Detection of Dynamic URL Construction:**
   - Look for `URL(string:)`, `NSURL(string:)`, `URLSession.shared.dataTask(with:)`, etc.

2. **Ensuring URL Validation:**
   - URLs should be validated against an allow list.
   - Ensure no raw user input is passed directly for request construction.

3. **Common Patterns:**
   - Detect if any user input directly influences URL creation.
   - Look for frameworks’ specific request functions such as `Alamofire.request()`, `HTTPClient.request()`, etc.

### Example SAST Rule Logic:

- **Identify Sources:** Detect user inputs like `textfield.text`, `params["url"]` that could be directly used to generate URLs.
- **Identify Sinks:** Functions/methods like `URL(string:)`, `Alamofire.request()`, `HTTPClient.request()` where the SSRF vulnerability may present.
- **Validation Conditions:** Ensure there are checks for valid URLs, presence of allow lists, and avoidance of direct user input assignments for URL creation.

#### Example High-Level Pseudocode for a SAST Rule:

```pseudo
if (userInput identified):
    if (input passed to URL creation function):
        if (no validation or sanitization):
            flag as potential SSRF issue
```

### Conclusion:
In constructing SAST rules for SSRF detection in Swift, focus on intercepting user input before its use in network requests, verifying that validations are in place, and specifically targeting popular frameworks in use. This approach ensures that rules are robust and have a high detection rate with minimal false positives, contributing to a secure codebase effectively.
