# Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') (CWE-079) in Swift

###### Overview: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation (Cross-site Scripting)

**Cross-site Scripting (XSS)** is a type of security vulnerability that typically affects web applications. It occurs when an attacker can inject malicious scripts into the web application to be executed in the context of another user's browser. This is generally due to improper neutralization of input during web page generation. 

#### Variations of XSS:

1. **Stored XSS**: Malicious script is stored on the server (e.g., in a database) and is later included in web pages that are sent to other users.
2. **Reflected XSS**: Malicious script comes from the current HTTP request and is reflected back by the server.
3. **DOM-based XSS**: The vulnerability is in the client-side code rather than in the server-side code.

To build a SAST tool detection rule, we need to focus on various Swift coding patterns and frameworks to detect XSS vulnerabilities with high accuracy (high false-negative, low false-positive rates).

### XSS Examples in Swift and Popular Frameworks
Here's a detailed explanation with various examples in Swift:

#### 1. Basic HTML Injection
Swift code to generate HTML using concatenation can be vulnerable if user inputs are not properly sanitized.

**Example 1.1:**
```swift
// Potentially dangerous example
let userInput = request.queryParams["input"] ?? ""
let html = "<html><body>\(userInput)</body></html>"
response.body(html)
```

**Rule to Detect:**
- Check for `response.body` usage with unsanitized user input directly interpolated in strings.

#### 2. Using Templating Engines (e.g., Leaf in Vapor)
Templating engines are popular in Swift web frameworks and improper usage can lead to XSS.

**Example 2.1:**
```swift
// Leaf template rendering
router.get("user") { req -> Future<View> in
    let username = req.query[String.self, at: "username"] ?? ""
    return try req.view().render("profile", ["username": username])
}
```

**Rule to Detect:**
- Ensure user inputs passed to `req.view().render` are sanitized or properly encoded.

#### 3. Dynamic HTML Content Generation
In Swift, dynamic content generation might use string concatenation which can lead to XSS.

**Example 3.1:**
```swift
// Dynamic content without encoding
let userComment = request.queryParams["comment"] ?? ""
let responseHTML = """
<html>
<head><title>User Comment</title></head>
<body>
<p>\(userComment)</p>
</body>
</html>
"""
response.body(responseHTML)
```

**Rule to Detect:**
- Look for HTML tags in strings that directly include user input without sanitization.

#### 4. Incorrect Handling in JSON Responses
While not HTML, improper handling of JSON can be a precursor to XSS if JSON is later rendered without proper escaping.

**Example 4.1:**
```swift
let unsafeData = request.queryParams["data"] ?? ""
let jsonResponse = "{\"data\": \"\(unsafeData)\"}"
response.body(jsonResponse)
```

**Rule to Detect:**
- Look for JSON serialization that directly includes potentially unsafe user inputs.

#### Preventive Measures:
1. **Sanitize Inputs**: Ensure all user inputs are sanitized. Use libraries to handle sanitization.
2. **Escape Outputs**: Properly escape outputs before rendering them into HTML.
3. **Content Security Policy (CSP)**: Define a strict CSP to mitigate the impact of XSS.

### Conclusion

For leveraging SAST tools to detect XSS in Swift, the detection rules should focus on identifying untrusted user inputs being directly interpolated or concatenated into HTML, JSON, or templating engines without proper sanitization. Context-aware sanitization techniques should be employed to ensure low false-positive rates.
