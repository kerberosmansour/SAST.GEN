# Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following') (CWE-059) in Swift

#### Explanation of Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')

**Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')** refers to security vulnerabilities that occur when an application improperly processes symbolic links or shortcuts (links) before accessing the targeted files. Attackers can exploit these issues to access or modify files they should not be able to, potentially leading to data breaches or unauthorized system control.

Common scenarios involve:
- **Symbolic Links**: When an application follows a symbolic link (symlink) to a different file or directory, it should ensure that the link and its target are permissible within the intended security context.
- **Hard Links**: Like symlinks, hard links can be exploited if an application resolves them improperly.
- **Directory Traversal**: Involves an attacker manipulating file paths, e.g., `../../etc/passwd` to access restricted files.

## Examples in Swift and Popular Frameworks

To detect variations of this vulnerability in Swift, the rules should focus on improper resolution of links before file operations. Below are examples and their corresponding potential vulnerabilities in different frameworks:

### 1. Standard Library: `FileManager`
**Example**:
```swift
import Foundation

let fileManager = FileManager.default
let symbolLinkPath = "/tmp/symbolic_link"
let destinationPath = "/tmp/important_file"

do {
    try fileManager.createSymbolicLink(atPath: symbolLinkPath, withDestinationPath: destinationPath)
    let data = try Data(contentsOf: URL(fileURLWithPath: symbolLinkPath))
    // Process data
} catch {
    print("Error: \(error)")
}
```
**Vulnerability**: If `/tmp/symbolic_link` points to a sensitive or unauthorized file and the operation does not validate the target file's permissions.

### 2. SwiftNIO Framework
**Example**:
```swift
import NIO
import Foundation

let eventLoopGroup = MultiThreadedEventLoopGroup(numberOfThreads: System.coreCount)
let fileIO = NonBlockingFileIO(threadPool: eventLoopGroup.next())

let symbolLinkPath = "/tmp/symbolic_link"

fileIO.openFile(path: symbolLinkPath, eventLoop: eventLoopGroup.next())
    .flatMap { fileHandle in
        fileIO.read(fileRegion: FileRegion(fileHandle: fileHandle), allocator: ByteBufferAllocator())
    }
    .whenComplete { result in
        switch result {
        case .success(let buffer):
            // Process buffer
            break
        case .failure(let error):
            print("Error: \(error)")
        }
    }
```
**Vulnerability**: The file system operations might follow symlinks without validating the destination, leading to unauthorized file access.

### 3. Vapor Framework
**Example**:
```swift
import Vapor

func routes(_ app: Application) throws {
    app.get("file") { req -> EventLoopFuture<Response> in
        let symbolLinkPath = "/tmp/symbolic_link"

        return req.fileio.streamFile(at: symbolLinkPath)
    }
}
```
**Vulnerability**: Serving files via symlinks without validating the link's target may expose sensitive files to users.

### Examples for SAST Rules

1. **Symbolic Link Creation without Validation**:
    - Detect `FileManager.createSymbolicLink`
    - Check that the destination path is validated properly against a whitelist or access policy.

2. **Improper File Access via Symbolic Link**:
    - Detect `Data(contentsOf:)`, `FileHandle(forReadingAtPath:)` initializing with a path directly.
    - Ensure the path derivation logic does not directly follow potentially unsafe symbolic links.

3. **Link Resolution in File IO operations**:
    - Detect methods like `FileIO.openFile` in SwiftNIO or `req.fileio.streamFile` in Vapor.
    - Check for proper validation and sanitization of target paths before usage.

To effectively craft SAST detection rules, it is essential to identify:
- Direct link creation/usage functions.
- Improper validation patterns.
- Context where path manipulation is allowed or disallowed.

Using these criteria:
- High false negatives can be avoided by ensuring all file access paths validate links.
- Low false positives ensured by checking validation logic existence near file operations.
