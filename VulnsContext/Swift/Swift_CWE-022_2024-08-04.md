# Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal') (CWE-022) in Swift

###### Understanding Path Traversal

Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory, commonly known as **Path Traversal**, refers to a security vulnerability where an attacker manipulates the file path parameter values to access files and directories that are stored outside the web root folder. This allows attackers to traverse directories (hence the name) and access sensitive files and data. The vulnerability usually arises due to improper validation or sanitization of user inputs used in file paths.

**Path Traversal Attack Example**:
- Suppose the application has the following code to read user files:
  ```swift
  let fileName = request.getParameter("file")
  let fullPath = "/users/data/" + fileName
  let fileContent = FileManager.default.contents(atPath: fullPath)
  ```

  If the input provided by the user is `../../etc/passwd`, the `fullPath` would resolve to `/users/etc/passwd`, potentially exposing sensitive system files.

### Variations and Examples in Swift

Path Traversal vulnerabilities can appear in different ways and within various Swift frameworks. Below are some examples to guide the writing of SAST rules:

#### 1. Simple File Access
In foundational Swift code:
```swift
import Foundation

func readFile(filePath: String) -> String? {
    let data = FileManager.default.contents(atPath: filePath)
    return data != nil ? String(data: data!, encoding: .utf8) : nil
}

// Usage
let userProvidedPath = "../../etc/passwd"
let content = readFile(filePath: "/files/" + userProvidedPath)
```
**Vulnerability**: If the user input (`userProvidedPath`) is not sanitized, an attacker could access files outside the intended directory.

#### 2. Using URL Paths
When dealing with URL paths:
```swift
func serveFile(requestPath: String) {
    let basePath = URL(fileURLWithPath: "/files")
    let fullPath = basePath.appendingPathComponent(requestPath).path
    let fileContent = FileManager.default.contents(atPath: fullPath)
    // serve the file content
}

// Usage
let userRequetedFile = "../../../etc/passwd"
serveFile(requestPath: userRequetedFile)
```
**Vulnerability**: The `appendingPathComponent` method does not prevent path traversal attacks.

#### 3. Web Framework Example (Vapor)
In a web application using the Vapor framework:
```swift
import Vapor

func routes(_ app: Application) throws {
    app.get("download") { req -> EventLoopFuture<Response> in
        let filename = try req.query.get(String.self, at: "file")
        let fullPath = app.directory.publicDirectory + filename
        return req.fileio.collectFile(at: fullPath).map { file in
            let response = Response()
            response.body = .init(data: file)
            return response
        }
    }
}

// Usage
// The endpoint /download?file=../../etc/passwd
```
**Vulnerability**: The Vapor framework does not inherently protect against path traversal in the example.

### Secure Coding Practices

**Mitigation** involves:
1. *Validating Input*: Ensure user inputs for file paths are validated against a whitelist of allowed directory names.
2. *Normalizing Paths*: Convert all file paths to their canonical form and restrict access outside the root directory.
3. *Using Framework Functions*: Utilize secure versions of functions provided by frameworks for handling file paths.

### Path Traversal Detection with SAST Tools

When writing SAST (Static Application Security Testing) rules, it's crucial to have:
- **High Accuracy**: To minimize false positives.
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: To capture all potential instances of path traversal.

**Detection Rules** could include looking for:
1. **Suspicious File Operations**:
   - Functions like `FileManager.default.contents(atPath:)`, `FileManager.default.fileExists(atPath:)`.
   - Functions forming paths like `appendingPathComponent()`.

2. **Dynamic Path Construction**:
   - String interpolations involving external inputs (`request.getParameter("file")`).

3. **Insecure File Handling in Frameworks**:
   - Custom routes, especially in web frameworks like Vapor which directly concatenate paths.

4. **Redundant or Incorrect Sanitization**:
   - Absence of path normalization or checking mechanisms.

By implementing robust detection of these patterns, SAST tools can effectively mitigate path traversal vulnerabilities in Swift applications and various frameworks.
