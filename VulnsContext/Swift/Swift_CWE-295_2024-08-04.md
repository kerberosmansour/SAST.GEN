# Improper Certificate Validation (CWE-295) in Swift

###### Understanding Improper Certificate Validation

Improper Certificate Validation occurs when a system inaccurately verifies the identity of a communicating peer by not correctly validating their digital certificates. This vulnerability can lead to various security risks such as Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks, where an attacker can intercept and manipulate communication between the client and server.

### Key Points

1. **Purpose of Certificate Validation:** Ensure that the certificate presented by a server is signed by a trusted Certificate Authority (CA) and matches the host it is meant to identify.
2. **Common Mistakes**: Ignoring errors in certificate validation, such as mismatched hostnames, expired certificates, or self-signed certificates without proper checks.

### Variations in Swift (for Popular Frameworks)

#### Using URLSession

`URLSession` is commonly used for network requests in Swift. An improper way of handling certificate validation often involves the URLSessionDelegate's `urlSession(_:didReceive:completionHandler:)` method.

**Vulnerable Code:**
```swift
func urlSession(_ session: URLSession, didReceive challenge: URLAuthenticationChallenge, completionHandler: @escaping (URLSession.AuthChallengeDisposition, URLCredential?) -> Void) {
    let credential = URLCredential(trust: challenge.protectionSpace.serverTrust!)
    completionHandler(.useCredential, credential)
}
```
**Explanation:** This code accepts any certificate presented by the server, bypassing crucial validation checking.

#### Using Alamofire

`Alamofire` is a popular networking library for Swift. Despite providing mechanisms to secure API calls, developers can misconfigure certificate validation.

**Vulnerable Code:**
```swift
let manager: Session = {
    let serverTrustPolicies: [String: ServerTrustPolicy] = [
        "example.com": .disableEvaluation
    ]
    return Session(
        serverTrustManager: ServerTrustManager(evaluators: serverTrustPolicies)
    )
}()
```
**Explanation:** This bypasses certificate validation for the specified domain (`example.com`), accepting any certificate.

#### Using a Custom URLSession

Creating custom URLConnection handlers often skips proper validation checks.

**Vulnerable Code:**
```swift
let url = URL(string: "https://example.com")!
let session = URLSession(configuration: .default, delegate: self, delegateQueue: nil)
let task = session.dataTask(with: url)
task.resume()

// URLSessionDelegate implementation
func urlSession(_ session: URLSession, didReceive challenge: URLAuthenticationChallenge, completionHandler: (URLSession.AuthChallengeDisposition, URLCredential?) -> Void) {
    guard let serverTrust = challenge.protectionSpace.serverTrust else {
        completionHandler(.cancelAuthenticationChallenge, nil)
        return
    }
    let credential = URLCredential(trust: serverTrust)
    completionHandler(.useCredential, credential)
}
```
**Explanation:** This accepts any server trust, effectively bypassing certificate validation.

### SAST Rule Development

For creating effective SAST rules with high true positive and low false positive rates, consider the following:

1. **Contextual Analysis**:
    - Ensure rules are specific to certain methods like `urlSession(_:didReceive:completionHandler:)`.
    - Validate that server trust evaluation actually verifies the certificate against a CA.

2. **Heuristics**:
    - Flag unconditional acceptance (`.useCredential`) of `URLCredential(trust:)` without evaluations.
    - Identify usage of `.disableEvaluation` in Alamofireâ€™s `ServerTrustPolicy`.

3. **Examples**:
    ```swift
    // Rule: URLSessionDelegate without proper validation
    func urlSession(_ session: URLSession, didReceive challenge: URLAuthenticationChallenge, completionHandler: @escaping (URLSession.AuthChallengeDisposition, URLCredential?) -> Void) {
        // Check for unconditional completion handler calls
        if challenge.protectionSpace.serverTrust {
            let credential = URLCredential(trust: challenge.protectionSpace.serverTrust!)
            completionHandler(.useCredential, credential) // Flag this
        }
    }

    // Rule: Alamofire's ServerTrustPolicy with disableEvaluation
    let serverTrustPolicies: [String: ServerTrustPolicy] = [
        "example.com": .disableEvaluation // Flag this
    ]
    ```

These examples illustrate how improper certificate validation can manifest in different ways within Swift applications and frameworks. By incorporating checks for these patterns, a SAST tool can effectively identify and mitigate vulnerabilities associated with improper certificate validation, ensuring secure communication in applications.
