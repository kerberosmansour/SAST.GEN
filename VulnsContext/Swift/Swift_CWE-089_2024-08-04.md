# Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection') (CWE-089) in Swift

###### Understanding SQL Injection

**Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command (‘SQL Injection’)** is a type of security vulnerability that occurs when an attacker can insert or "inject" arbitrary SQL code into a query. This can happen when the application uses untrusted input to construct SQL queries without proper validation, escaping, or sanitization of the input data.

### Key Concepts

1. **Dynamic SQL Queries**: When SQL queries are built by concatenating strings, user inputs can manipulate the queries to alter the intended operations.
2. **Unsanitized Inputs**: User inputs that are directly used in SQL statements without validation or escaping can lead to injection attacks.
3. **Risks**:
    - Unauthorized data access.
    - Data manipulation (e.g., insertion, update, deletion).
    - Execution of administrative operations on the database (e.g., shutting down the database).
    - Disclosure of sensitive information.

### General Examples
Consider the following scenario:
```swift
let customerId = request.getParameter("id")
let query = "SELECT * FROM accounts WHERE custID='\(customerId)'"
```
If `customerId` is manipulated to include SQL code, it can alter the query’s behavior.

### How to Prevent SQL Injection
1. **Use Prepared Statements (with Parameterized Queries)**: This separates SQL code from data, ensuring that input data does not modify the query’s structure.
2. **Use ORMs (Object-Relational Mapping Tools)**: ORMs like Hibernate can help prevent SQL injection by abstracting direct SQL manipulations.
3. **Validate User Inputs**: Employ both client-side and server-side validation to ensure inputs meet expected formats and data types.
4. **Use Whitelists**: For input validation, using whitelists ensures only acceptable input is processed.

## SQL Injection in Swift

### Common Vulnerabilities in Swift and Frameworks

#### Example 1: Raw SQL Query Execution (Vapor Framework)
```swift
import Vapor
import FluentSQLite

final class UserController {
    func getUserById(_ req: Request) throws -> Future<User> {
        let userId = try req.parameters.next(Int.self)
        return req.withPooledConnection(to: .sqlite) { conn in
            return conn.raw("SELECT * FROM User WHERE id = \(userId)").all(decoding: User.self)
        }
    }
}
```
**Potential Risk**: If `userId` is not properly validated and sanitized, it can lead to SQL injection. 

#### Example 2: Direct Query Execution Without Parameters (Kitura Framework)
```swift
import Kitura
import SwiftKuery
import SwiftKuerySQLite

let router = Router()
router.get("/users/:id") { request, response, next in
    let userId = request.parameters["id"] ?? ""
    let query = "SELECT * FROM Users WHERE id = \(userId)"
    // Execute the query
}
```
**Potential Risk**: Crafting `userId` maliciously could alter the intended query.

### Swift Security Best Practices

#### Using Parameterized Queries
```swift
import Vapor
import FluentSQLite

final class UserController {
    func getUserById(_ req: Request) throws -> Future<User> {
        let userId = try req.parameters.next(Int.self)
        return req.withPooledConnection(to: .sqlite) { conn in
            return conn.raw("SELECT * FROM User WHERE id = ?")
                     .bind(userId)
                     .all(decoding: User.self)
        }
    }
}
```
**Safe Approach**: Binding the parameter ensures input data is treated as a value rather than executable SQL.

#### Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) Usage
```swift
import Vapor
import FluentSQLite

final class User: SQLiteModel {
    var id: Int?
    var name: String
}

final class UserController {
    func getUserById(_ req: Request) throws -> Future<User> {
        let userId = try req.parameters.next(Int.self)
        return User.find(userId, on: req).unwrap(or: Abort(.notFound))
    }
}
```
**ORMs**: Abstractions like Fluent ORM help to avoid direct SQL manipulation and reduce injection risks.

### Conclusion for SAST Detection

To formulate robust SAST detection rules for SQL injection in Swift, focus on:
1. Detecting plain string concatenations involving SQL keywords and user inputs.
2. Identifying usage patterns of common libraries/frameworks (e.g., Vapor, Kitura) where raw SQL queries might be executed.
3. Checking for functions that directly execute SQL statements using raw, unsanitized user inputs.
4. Implementing heuristics that recognize parameter binding functions, which generally indicate safe code.

By zeroing in on the patterns commonly associated with vulnerabilities, a Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tool can more accurately flag potential injection points while reducing false positives.
