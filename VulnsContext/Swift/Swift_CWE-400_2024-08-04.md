# Uncontrolled Resource Consumption (CWE-400) in Swift

#### Uncontrolled Resource Consumption: Explanation and Detection in Swift

### Understanding Uncontrolled Resource Consumption

Uncontrolled Resource Consumption (URC) happens when an application allows the unregulated use of critical resources such as CPU, memory, disk space, or network bandwidth. If not properly managed, this can lead to Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks, where legitimate users are unable to access the service. Some key strategies to mitigate URC involve:

1. **Rate limiting**: Restricting the number of requests a user can make.
2. **Input validation**: Ensuring user inputs do not trigger resource-intensive operations.
3. **Session management**: Limiting the duration and data bound to sessions.
4. **Resource allocation controls**: Ensuring operations do not consume excessive CPU or memory.

### Variations of Uncontrolled Resource Consumption in Swift

Below are examples of how URC can manifest in Swift applications, including those using popular frameworks such as Swift Standard Library, SwiftNIO, and Vapor. Each example will outline how the resource can be consumed excessively and how it can be detected using Static Application Security Testing (SAST) rules with a focus on high true positive and low false positive rates.

#### 1. **Memory Leaks**

**Swift Standard Library - Arrays**
```swift
var largeArray = Array(repeating: 0, count: 1_000_000_000)
```
*Explanation*: Creating a very large array can consume a significant amount of memory.

**Detection**:
- **Rule**: Look for large array initializations, especially in loops or high-frequency code paths.
- **Threshold**: Initializing arrays larger than a configurable threshold, e.g., 10^6 elements.
- **False Positives**: Minimized by checking array usage context, e.g., whether itâ€™s needed for critical performance.

#### 2. **CPU Overload**

**Swift Standard Library - Sorting Algorithms**
```swift
let sortedArray = someArray.sorted { $0 > $1 }
```
*Explanation*: Sorting a very large array can consume a lot of CPU time.

**Detection**:
- **Rule**: Identify loops or functions where sorting is applied to very large collections, especially if used frequently.
- **Threshold**: Collections beyond a certain size, say 10^6 elements.
- **False Positives**: Consider the context and necessity; legitimate uses in isolated scenarios can be ignored.

#### 3. **Concurrency Issues**

**SwiftNIO - Event Loop Blocking**
```swift
let eventLoop = eventLoopGroup.next()
eventLoop.execute {
    let _ = try? heavyComputationFunction()
}
```
*Explanation*: Blocking the event loop with heavy computation starves the loop, causing performance degradation.

**Detection**:
- **Rule**: Detect blocking calls within event loop tasks.
- **Specific Patterns**: Functions with significant computation within event loop handlers or execute blocks.
- **False Positives**: Analyze function complexity or usage of blocking API calls within non-concurrent context.

#### 4. **File System Misuse**

**Vapor - File Uploads**
```swift
app.post("upload") { req in
    let data = try! req.content.decode(FileUpload.self)
    try data.file.write(to: "/uploads/\(data.filename)")
}
```
*Explanation*: Large or excessive file uploads without constraints can deplete disk space.

**Detection**:
- **Rule**: Inspect file handling routes for size and number constraints.
- **Pattern**: File operations without size limitations in routes.
- **False Positives**: Ensure checks for storage limits and file size constraints are present before flagging.

### Recommendations for SAST Rule Writing

To ensure the SAST rules are robust, consider the following suggestions:
1. **Thresholds**: Make thresholds (e.g., array size, file upload limits) configurable to adapt to different applications' contexts.
2. **Context-Aware Analysis**: Evaluate the context where potential URC patterns occur to reduce false positives. 
3. **Framework-Specific Rules**: Tailor rules for different frameworks (e.g., Vapor, SwiftNIO) to accurately capture relevant patterns.
4. **Nested Analysis**: For recursion or nested operations (e.g., sorting within a loop), look deeper to understand potential cumulative impact.
5. **Documentation and Examples**: Provide clear documentation and examples for each rule to help users understand how and why detections are made.

By implementing the above detection mechanisms, you can help ensure high accuracy in identifying uncontrolled resource consumption vulnerabilities while minimizing false positives.
