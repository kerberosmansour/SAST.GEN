# Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference (CWE-611) in Swift

#### Explanation of XXE Vulnerability

**Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference**, also known as XXE (XML External Entity) Injection, is a vulnerability where an application accepts untrusted XML input and improperly processes it, allowing attackers to interfer with an application’s processing of XML data. It's listed under CWE-611【4:0†source】 .

## Description

XXE can cause severe impacts, such as:

- **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)**: It can force the server to make HTTP requests from within the internal network.
- **File Disclosure**: With specific payloads, it can expose sensitive files on the server.
- **Remote Code Execution**: In unpatched systems, it might escalate to executing malicious code.
- **Denial of Service**: It can lead to resource exhaustion through multiple entity references.

The safest method to prevent XXE is to disable external entities and Document Type Declarations (DTDs) completely.

## Examples in Swift

### 1. Foundation's XMLParser

```swift
import Foundation
class XMLParserDelegate: NSObject, XMLParserDelegate {
    func parser(_ parser: XMLParser, didStartElement elementName: String, namespaceURI: String?, qualifiedName qName: String?, attributes attributeDict: [String : String] = [:]) {
        // Handle element
    }
}

let xmlString = """
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<!DOCTYPE foo [ <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd"> ]>
<foo>&xxe;</foo>
"""
if let data = xmlString.data(using: .utf8) {
    let parser = XMLParser(data: data)
    let parserDelegate = XMLParserDelegate()

    // Disable external entities
    parser.shouldResolveExternalEntities = false
    parser.delegate = parserDelegate
    parser.parse()
}
```

In this example, it's crucial to set `parser.shouldResolveExternalEntities` to `false` to avoid processing external entities.

### 2. SWXMLHash

```swift
import SWXMLHash

let xmlString = """
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<!DOCTYPE foo [ <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd"> ]>
<foo>&xxe;</foo>
"""

let opts = SWXMLHash.config { config in
    config.shouldProcessNamespaces = true
    config.shouldTrimWhitespace = true
    config.shouldProcessLazily = false

    // Configurations to prevent XXE
    config.parserOptions = [.disallowExternalEntities]
}

let xml = opts.parse(xmlString)

let foo = xml["foo"].element?.text // Should not process &xxe;
```

Here, to prevent XXE, it’s necessary to disallow external entities by setting `.disallowExternalEntities` during configuration.

### Implementing SAST Rule Detection in Swift

When creating SAST rules for detecting XXE vulnerabilities, focus on:
1. Parser configuration for external entities:
    - Check if `shouldResolveExternalEntities` is set to `false`.
    - Inspect for usage and configuration of third-party libraries like SWXMLHash.
2. Ensure there's no use of unmodified user input being parsed directly.

### Considered Frameworks and Variations
- **Foundation (XMLParser)**: Common in native Swift applications.
- **SWXMLHash**: A third-party XML parser widely used for its simplicity and features.
- **AEXML**: Another third-party parser where similar configuration checks should be applied.

### General Rule Outline

1. **For `XMLParser`:**
   - Rule: Ensure `parser.shouldResolveExternalEntities` is set to `false`.

2. **For Third-Party Libraries:**
   - Rule: Ensure there is a configuration setting applied to disable external entities.

### Sample SAST Rule (Pseudocode)
```pseudocode
rule "Disable External Entities in XML Parsing":
    when:
        pattern = <Parser Initialization>
        config = <Parser Configuration>
    
    if (parser=="XMLParser" && shouldResolveExternalEntities != false):
        report "Potential XXE vulnerability found!"

    if (parser == "SWXMLHash" && !config.contains(".disallowExternalEntities")):
        report "Potential XXE vulnerability found in SWXMLHash configuration!"
```

By accurately identifying and flagging instances where external entity resolution isn't properly configured, these rules can significantly reduce false negatives while maintaining a low false-positive rate.
