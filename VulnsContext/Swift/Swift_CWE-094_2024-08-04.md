# Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection') (CWE-094) in Swift

###### Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')

Improper Control of Generation of Code, commonly referred to as Code Injection, is a security vulnerability where an application improperly uses untrusted data in the generation of code segments dynamically. This flaw can grant attackers the ability to execute arbitrary code on the server or client-side by injecting it within the context where the dynamic code generation occurs. The main causes can include failing to adequately validate, filter, or sanitize user inputs that are subsequently used in the code generation process【4:0†source】【4:1†source】.

#### Variations in Swift:
1. **String Interpolation without Validation**
    ```swift
    let userScript = "print('\(userInput)')"
    let jsContext = JSContext()!
    jsContext.evaluateScript(userScript)
    ```
    If `userInput` contains malicious JavaScript code, it would be executed. Always sanitize inputs before embedding them into scripts.

2. **Dynamic SQL Queries**
    ```swift
    let query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = '\(userId)'"
    database.execute(query)
    ```
    Using user-provided inputs directly in SQL queries can lead to SQL injection. Utilize parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent this.

3. **Shell Command Injections**
    ```swift
    let command = "ls \(directory)"
    system(command)
    ```
    If `directory` can be controlled by the user and is not properly sanitized, a shell command injection may occur. Validate and sanitize inputs or use safe API calls.

### Swift Code Injection in Popular Frameworks:
1. **Vapor (Server-side Swift)**:
    - Example of dynamic routing which might cause code injection:
      ```swift
      router.get("hello", String.parameter) { req -> String in
          let name = try req.parameters.next(String.self)
          return "<h1>Hello \(name)</h1>"
      }
      ```
      Rendering HTML directly from user input can lead to HTML injection. Always escape HTML special characters to neutralize potential code segments.

2. **SwiftNIO**:
    - Raw data processing in a non-blocking server:
      ```swift
      class MyHandler: ChannelInboundHandler {
          typealias InboundIn = ByteBuffer
          func channelRead(context: ChannelHandlerContext, data: NIOAny) {
              var byteBuffer = self.unwrapInboundIn(data)
              let userInput = byteBuffer.readString(length: byteBuffer.readableBytes) ?? ""
              context.write(self.wrapOutboundOut(.someProcessing(userInput)))
          }
      }
      ```
      Handling raw user data could be dangerous if not properly sanitized before processing.

3. **Kitura**:
    - Handling user input for template rendering:
      ```swift
      router.get("/user/:name") { request, response, next in
          let name = request.parameters["name"] ?? "unknown"
          try response.send("Hello \(name)").end()
      }
      ```
      Template injection through unsanitized user inputs can be exploited. Ensure proper escaping when rendering user inputs.

### Detection Strategies for SAST Tools:
To create SAST rules with high precision and low false positives for detecting code injection issues in Swift, consider these patterns:
1. **String Interpolation of User Inputs**:
    - Detect code segments where external inputs (e.g., from user inputs or external files) are embedded directly into string literals.
    - Flag usage of `String(parameter)` and `String.` methods when concatenating dynamic content.

2. **Dynamic Code Evaluation**:
    - Monitor the usage of `evaluateScript`, `NSExpression`, and similar APIs where external inputs could lead to the execution of arbitrary code.
  
3. **SQL Query Generation**:
    - Identify raw SQL query constructions using string interpolation due to the potential risk of SQL Injection. Recommend using ORM or parameterized queries.
  
4. **Shell Command Execution**:
    - Trace occurrences of `system()`, `Process()`, or other APIs that execute shell commands with user inputs.

5. **Template Rendering**:
    - Check for dynamic content embedding in HTML templates, especially in popular web frameworks such as Vapor and Kitura. Ensure contexts where HTML escaping functions are used.

Implementing these detection strategies can significantly improve the interception of potential code injection vulnerabilities in Swift applications, enhancing security and minimizing attack surfaces【4:2†source】【4:9†source】.
