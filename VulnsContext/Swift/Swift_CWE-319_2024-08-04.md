# Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information (CWE-319) in Swift

###### Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information

**Definition:**
Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information occurs when sensitive data is transmitted without encryption, allowing potential attackers to intercept and read the data easily. This is classified under CWE-319【4:0†source】【4:2†source】【4:3†source】【4:4†source】【4:5†source】【4:6†source】【4:7†source】【4:8†source】【4:9†source】【4:10†source】【4:11†source】【4:12†source】【4:13†source】【4:14†source】【4:15†source】【4:16†source】【4:17†source】【4:18†source】【4:19†source】.

### Variations in Swift

In Swift, cleartext transmission can happen in various ways, particularly when using popular frameworks. Here are a few examples:

#### 1. URLSession without HTTPS
One common scenario is using `URLSession` to send or receive data over HTTP instead of HTTPS:

```swift
let url = URL(string: "http://example.com/api/data")!
var request = URLRequest(url: url)
request.httpMethod = "POST"
let session = URLSession.shared
let task = session.dataTask(with: request) { data, response, error in
    // Handle response
}
task.resume()
```

#### 2. Alamofire without HTTPS
When using Alamofire, an advanced Swift-based HTTP networking library, it's essential to ensure that all requests use HTTPS:

```swift
import Alamofire

Alamofire.request("http://example.com/api/data", method: .post, parameters: ["foo": "bar"]).response { response in
    // Handle response
}
```

#### 3. Using WebSocket without WSS
WebSocket connections should use `wss` instead of `ws` to ensure that data transmitted through WebSockets is encrypted:

```swift
import Foundation

let url = URL(string: "ws://example.com/socket")!
let webSocketTask = URLSession.shared.webSocketTask(with: url)
webSocketTask.resume()
```

#### 4. Firebase Database without HTTPS
Firebase real-time database URLs should always be HTTPS:

```swift
import Firebase

let ref = Database.database().reference(fromURL: "http://example.firebaseio.com")
ref.setValue("SomeValue")
```

### Writing SAST Detection Rules

When creating SAST rules for detecting cleartext transmission of sensitive information, consider the following:

1. **False Positives Minimization:**
   - Ensure the rule precisely matches HTTP URLs and avoids HTTPS.
   - Consider context; for instance, make sure the URL is not in a comment or a string that isn't used for network requests.

2. **False Negatives Minimization:**
   - Include all known networking frameworks (URLSession, Alamofire, Firebase, WebSocket, etc.).
   - Detect both inline URL strings and dynamically constructed URLs that potentially start with "http://".

3. **Rule Examples:**

```python
# Pseudo-code for a SAST rule
rule cleartext_transmission:
    strings:
        $http_pattern = /http:\/\//i
    condition:
        $http_pattern and
        any of (is_network_request_method("URLSession"), is_network_request_method("Alamofire"), is_network_request_method("WebSocket"), is_network_request_method("Firebase"))
```

```swift
// Example detection regex
let pattern = "http://[^/\"]+"
let regex = try! NSRegularExpression(pattern: pattern, options: [.caseInsensitive])
let range = NSRange(location: 0, length: sourceCode.utf16.count)
let matches = regex.matches(in: sourceCode, options: [], range: range)
for match in matches {
    let matchRange = match.range(at: 0)
    let matchedString = (sourceCode as NSString).substring(with: matchRange)
    print("Cleartext URL found: \(matchedString)")
}
```

In summary, ensuring secure transmission of sensitive information in Swift applications involves strictly using secure protocols such as HTTPS and WSS, particularly when employing popular network-related frameworks and libraries. Rules for a SAST tool must be designed to accurately detect potential violations while keeping false positives and negatives at a minimum.
