# Access of Resource Using Incompatible Type ('Type Confusion') (CWE-843) in JavaScript

###### Explanation of Access of Resource Using Incompatible Type ('Type Confusion')

**Access of Resource Using Incompatible Type ('Type Confusion')** is a software vulnerability that occurs when a program accesses a resource using an incompatible type, resulting in unexpected behavior or security flaws. Essentially, the program misinterprets the type of an input or resource, leading to improper operations and potential security risks.

This type of vulnerability can lead to various issues such as:
1. **Data Corruption**: Accessing memory or data using an incompatible type can corrupt data, leading to crashes or incorrect behavior.
2. **Security Risks**: Attackers may exploit type confusion to execute arbitrary code, access restricted memory, or perform unauthorized actions, which are particularly dangerous in web applications and other critical software.

### Variations of Type Confusion in JavaScript

JavaScript, being a dynamically typed language, is inherently susceptible to type confusion, especially when interacting with different types of inputs and data structures. Here are some common scenarios where type confusion might occur in JavaScript, especially within popular frameworks:

1. **Function Overloads**:
    ```javascript
    function processData(input) {
        if (typeof input === 'string') {
            // Handle string input
        } else if (typeof input === 'number') {
            // Handle number input
        }
    }
    
    processData("someString"); // Safe
    processData(42); // Safe
    processData(null); // Type confusion, may lead to unexpected behavior
    ```

2. **Type Coercion in Comparisons**:
    ```javascript
    if (0 == '0') {
        // This block will be executed due to type coercion
    }

    if ('0' === 0) {
        // This block will not be executed (strict comparison, no type coercion)
    }
    ```

3. **DOM Manipulation with incompatible types (React or Angular)**:
    ```javascript
    // React Example
    function ListComponent(props) {
        return (
            <ul>
                {props.items.map(item => (
                    <li key={item.id}>{item.name}</li>
                ))}
            </ul>
        );
    }

    // Usage
    const items = [{id: 1, name: 'Item 1'}, {id: 2, name: 'Item 2'}];
    <ListComponent items={items} />; // Safe

    <ListComponent items="Just a string"> // Type confusion, `map` is not a function on string
    ```

4. **Function Parameters in Libraries (Lodash example)**:
    ```javascript
    const _ = require('lodash');

    let array = [1, 2, 3];
    _.map(array, (num) => num * 3); // Safe, returns [3, 6, 9]

    let notAnArray = "string value";
    _.map(notAnArray, (num) => num * 3); // Type confusion
    ```

5. **Mismatched Object Types in Data Transfer**:
    ```javascript
    // Assuming a function expecting a data object
    function fetchData(config) {
        // Do something with config
    }

    let config = { url: 'http://api.example.com', method: 'GET' };
    fetchData(config); // Safe

    fetchData("Invalid config object"); // Type confusion, could lead to failure
    ```

### Recommendations for SAST Tool Detection Rules

1. **Check for Dynamic Type Checking and Coercion**:
    - Identify places where loose equality (`==`) is used and suggest using strict equality (`===`).
    - Detect implicit type conversions and alert the developer.

2. **Ensure Function Parameter Type Consistency**:
    - Recognize functions that are overloaded with different parameter types and validate usage.
    - Ensure that type checking within these functions is consistent and comprehensive.

3. **Validate Data Structures**:
    - Validate that data structures such as arrays, objects, or lists used in DOM manipulations or data processing activities are of expected types.

4. **Library Function Use**:
    - Identify common library functions like those in Lodash, and ensure that the types of arguments passed are as expected.

5. **Environment-Specific Concerns (like TypeScript with React)**:
    - Ensure type-safety mechanisms are enforced properly in TypeScript projects.
    - Check for correct prop types in React components.

6. **Use of Type Assertions and Casts**:
    - Detect inappropriate or unsafe use of type assertions or casts in TypeScript.

These examples illustrate various ways in which type confusion can manifest in JavaScript applications. Static analysis tools should be designed to detect these patterns and alert developers to potential type confusion vulnerabilities, thus increasing the robustness and security of the codebase.
