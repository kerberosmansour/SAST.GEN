# Uncontrolled Search Path Element (CWE-427) in TypeScript

###### Uncontrolled Search Path Element in TypeScript and Popular Frameworks

#### Definition and Explanation

An "Uncontrolled Search Path Element" vulnerability occurs when an application includes a path that is influenced by a user without proper validation or sanitization. This can lead to the inclusion of unintended directories containing malicious code, resulting in unintended command execution or exposure of sensitive data.

#### Explanation for SAST Tool Rule Author

To write effective SAST detection rules for "Uncontrolled Search Path Element" vulnerabilities in TypeScript, itâ€™s crucial to understand the contexts and patterns in which these vulnerabilities typically appear. It's essential to understand how file paths and environment variable manipulations are handled across different frameworks.

### Examples in TypeScript

Below are illustrative examples in TypeScript that demonstrate various implementations and frameworks where uncontrolled search path element vulnerabilities might manifest. 

1. **Node.js with General Path Manipulation**
    ```typescript
    import fs from 'fs';
    import path from 'path';

    const readUserFile = (userProvidedPath: string) => {
        const fullPath = path.join(__dirname, userProvidedPath);
        fs.readFile(fullPath, 'utf8', (err, data) => {
            if (err) {
                console.error(err);
            } else {
                console.log(data);
            }
        });
    }

    // User provides a path like "../etc/passwd"
    readUserFile("../etc/passwd");
    ```
    Here, the `path.join` function combines the `__dirname` with a user-provided path, which could potentially give access to sensitive files.

2. **Express Framework**
    ```typescript
    import express from 'express';
    import path from 'path';

    const app = express();

    app.get('/view', (req, res) => {
        const filePath = path.join(__dirname, req.query.page as string);
        res.sendFile(filePath);
    });

    app.listen(3000, () => {
        console.log('Server is running on port 3000');
    });
    ```
    In this instance, an attacker might manipulate the `page` query parameter to read sensitive files from the server.

3. **Electron Framework**
    ```typescript
    import { app, BrowserWindow } from 'electron';
    import path from 'path';

    let mainWindow: BrowserWindow;

    const createWindow = () => {
        mainWindow = new BrowserWindow({
            width: 800,
            height: 600,
            webPreferences: {
                preload: path.join(__dirname, process.env.PRELOAD_SCRIPT || 'default-preload.js')
            }
        });

        mainWindow.loadFile('index.html');
    }

    app.on('ready', createWindow);
    ```
    Here, the `process.env.PRELOAD_SCRIPT` is user-controllable, potentially leading to the execution of arbitrary scripts.

### SAST Rule Suggestions

To detect these patterns effectively, the following rule details would be necessary:

1. **Path Manipulation Operations**:
    - Identify the use of `path.join`, `path.resolve`, etc., where one or more arguments are dynamically influenced by user input or environment variables.

2. **Unsanitized and Unvalidated Input**:
    - Trace the sources of inputs (e.g., request parameters, environment variables) to see if they are used directly in path operations without validation.
    - Regular expressions or Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) parsing can be used to identify patterns where inputs are concatenated or joined in paths.

3. **Framework-Specific Patterns**:
    - For `express`, track usage in `req.query`, `req.params`, or `req.body` in path construction.
    - For `electron`, check `webPreferences.preload`, `app.getPath()`, `BrowserWindow.loadFile`, etc., for unvalidated dynamic inputs.

### Mitigations and Best Practices

1. **Input Validation and Sanitization**:
    - Use rigorous validation to ensure that only expected and safe values are processed.
    - Consider using a whitelist approach where only pre-approved paths or filenames are accepted.

2. **Library or Utility Functions**:
    - Where possible, use library functions designed to securely handle paths, such as those validating and sanitizing path inputs.

3. **Environment Variable Controls**:
    - Avoid using environment variables directly in paths. If necessary, ensure they are validated against expected safe values.

4. **Applying Permissions and Discovery Mechanisms**:
    - Apply appropriate file system permissions to ensure restrictive access.
    - Implement file discovery mechanisms that reduce the chance of exploration or enumeration beyond intended directories.

By focusing on these aspects, a SAST tool can be fine-tuned to minimize false positives and false negatives, providing robust detection for "Uncontrolled Search Path Element" vulnerabilities in TypeScript applications across various frameworks.
